    "Using Flair Financial Sentiment:\n",
    "1. Flair handles tokenization, normalization, part-of-speech tagging, and word embedding generation\n",
    "2. Build LDA model with gensim or sklearn, then train the model on preprocessed text data (sequences of word vectors)\n",
    "3. Tune number of topics\n",
    "4. Use something to determine topic coherence for validation\n",
    "5. Feed the topics to finVADER, which will return sentiment scores for each topic\n",
    "6. Aggregate the scores, weighting by importance of topic\n",
    "\n",
    "Concerns: Roundabout way of achieving the same thing that finVADER achives out of the box.\\\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "1. Feeding finVADER topics instead of the whole text directs its analysis towards relevant keywords and phrases, so it doesn't focus on irrelevant text\n",
    "2. Greater interpretability in the model. We can see how finVADER interprets specific topics and how those topics drive the sentiment score"

    "Sentiment Scoring:\\\n",
    "VADER uses a lexicon dictionary, and it is good at understanding specific words like slang and emojis in informal texts\\\n",
