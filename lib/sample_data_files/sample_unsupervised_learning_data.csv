0,4235,AAPL,"Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Apple, And Amazon Lead Big Tech Earnings This Week",https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/22/07/28189250/microsoft-alphabet-meta-apple-and-amazon-lead-big-tech-earnings-this-week,"(Monday Market Open) Investors appear optimistic to start the new week as equity index futures headed higher ahead of the opening bell. However, there’s a full economic calendar this week including the Federal Open Market Committee’s interest rate decision on Wednesday.Potential Market MoversThis morning, the CME FedWatch Tool was calculating a 77.5% probability that the Fed would raise the overnight rate 75 basis points on Wednesday. The probabilities are likely to rise the closer we get to the announcement, so it will likely fall to the accompanying statement and press conference with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that to move the market on the rate picture.Thursday’s gross domestic product (GDP) has the potential to be controversial as well because of the ongoing debate over what constitutes a recession. Historically, two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth have defined a recession, but some, including the White House, are arguing this time it’s different because of the strength of the U.S. jobs market.In the first quarter, GDP was -1.3%. Currently, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow tool is projecting -1.6% growth the second quarter. However, the unemployment rate is just 3.6%. Therefore, all eyes will be on the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) because they get the privilege of determining whether or not a recession is “official.”Whatever happens with the labeling, the GDP report should help analysts and investors see where the weaknesses are in the economy.However, recession fears aren’t limited to the U.S. The July German Business Climate Index, which measures economic expectations for the next six months, came in lower than expected and much lower than the previous month. The survey of German manufacturers, builders, wholesalers, and retailers revealed that many of them are expecting a recession in Germany. The German DAX was trading 0.3% higher overnight despite the news.Today’s a packed earnings calendar with releases from NXP Semiconductors NXPI, Whirlpool WHR, and F5 Networks FFIV. But there are big tech hitters reporting throughout the week including Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta META, Apple AAPL, and Amazon AMZN. Energy giants Exxon Mobil XOM and Chevron CVX will also report this week.Reviewing the Market MinutesThe stock market ended a positive week on a sour note when the S&P 500® index (SPX), Nasdaq ($COMP), and Dow Jones Industrials ($DJI) respectively fell 0.93%, 1.87%, and 0.43% on Friday. However, the indexes did end the week with gains of 2.6%, 2.0%, and 3.3% respectively.Stocks appeared to be dragged down by negative manufacturing news from Australia, France, Germany, and Japan. Each reported preliminary manufacturing numbers that suggested manufacturing in each country was contracting. The news fed the global economic slowdown narrative that has been haunting stocks.  Internet stocks took an additional hit as Snap SNAP and Twitter TWTR reported earnings misses. SNAP had the biggest miss by far, causing it to plunge 39.08% on the day. However, Twitter was able to eke out a 0.81% gain. Despite the split reactions to the misses, other internet stocks fell. Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Pinterest (PINS) tumbled 5.63%, 7.59%, and 13.51% respectively.The consumer discretionary sector was the week’s top performer for the week as the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector Index rose about 5% from Monday’s opening price. The Industrials Select Sector Index climbed just shy of 3.5%. The Materials Select Sector Index and the Real Estate Select Sector Index both rallied 2.8% to round out the top three sectors.Investors appeared to ignore stocks in the defensive sectors as health care, utilities, and consumer staples ended the week near even.Not only was the consumer discretionary sector the best sector last week, it’s on track to be the best for the month. The consumer discretionary index was up 12.25% from the first of July to last Friday’s close. The Technology Select Sector Index is in second place at 9.14%. These two indexes represented the only sectors to outpace the S&P 500 over that time frame. The Utilities Select Sector Index was the only sector index to be in the red so far this month, down -1.84%.

CHART OF THE DAY: CONSUMER STRENGTH: The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector Index ($IXY—candlesticks) has underperformed the S&P 500 (SPX—pink) over the last 12 months. However, the consumer discretionary index is gaining in relative strength (green) against the S&P 500, which could be a bullish sign for the sector. Data Sources: ICE, S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

Three Things to WatchSKEWED UP: The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector Index closed near its June high last week as investors found a taste for growth stocks. Amazon AMZN and Tesla TSLA are the two largest companies in the capitalization-weighted index and account for approximately 42% of its performance. With AMZN and TSLA skewing the returns of the index, it’s difficult to say if investors are bullish on consumer discretionary stocks in total or just Amazon and Tesla. An investor would need to break down the industry groups within the sector to better determine the demand.EARNINGS UPDATE: According to Refinitiv, S&P 500 companies for the Q2 2022 earnings season are on track for 6.2% earnings growth year over year. However, when excluding energy, growth falls to -3.2%. So far, 106 of the S&P 500’s companies have reported earnings with 75.5% beating analysts’ estimates, which is above the long-term average of 66.1% but lower than the previous four-quarter average of 80.6%.The energy sector has the highest earnings growth rate at a whopping 259.6% year over year. Industrials are second at 26%, and financials are the worst at -22.1%.GETTING BEAT: S&P 500 companies are still reporting fewer and smaller earnings surprises than the last five-year average, according to FactSet. The financials and communications sectors have had the greatest number of earnings misses. Utilities and health care have reported the highest number of earnings beats, while energy and industrials have reported the fewest. However, energy and industrials are also reporting a high number of earnings in-line with analyst estimates.Notable Calendar ItemsJuly 26: New home sales and earnings from Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Visa V, Coca-Cola KO, McDonald’s MCD, United Parcel Services UPS, and 3M MMMJuly 27: Durable goods orders, Pending home sales, FOMC interest rate decision and earnings from Meta META, Qualcomm QCOM, Rio Tinto RIO, Boeing BA, and Automatic Data Processing ADPJuly 28: Gross domestic product (GDP) and earnings from Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Mastercard MA, Intel INTC, and Caterpillar CATJuly 29: PCE Price Index and earnings from Exxon Mobil XOM, Procter & Gamble PG, and Chevron CVXAug 1: ISM Manufacturing PMI and earnings from Activision Blizzard ATVI, Simon Property SPG, Devon Energy DVN, and Aflac AFLTD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

Apple, Tesla Suppliers Among Companies Needing To ‘Make Adjustments’ As Heatwave In China Hits Production
After a record-setting heatwave in the Chinese lithium hub Sichuan province, authorities are rationing electricity supply to factories until Saturday, forcing major production giants to either halt production or “make adjustments.”
Chinese state media reported that due to the heatwave, the temperatures in the province hovered above 40-42 degrees celsius (104-108 degrees Fahrenheit) in the past week, sending power demands soaring and increasing the demand for air conditioning.
The electricity rationing has affected the production of many tech giants, including   Apple Inc’s AAPL supplier BOE Technology Group Co Ltd. The company said it would “make adjustments” to its operations in Sichuan due to low supply in the region.

2,3,AAPL,"Market Rebounds On Trade Optimism, Tech Bounce; Jobs Report Stronger Than Expected",https://www.benzinga.com/node/12934767,"A stronger-than-expected government report on the nation’s employment situation provided investors with some good news to cap a dismal week that saw worries about global economic growth ratchet up.Total nonfarm payrolls in December surged 312,000, well above the 180,000 jobs economists in a Briefing.com consensus had been expecting. November’s number was revised upward from 155,000 to 176,000. The report showed that average hourly earnings on a monthly basis rose more than expected. That figure came in at 0.4% instead of the 0.3% gain that had been expected. Over the past year, average hourly earnings are up 3.2%. Treasury rates rose after the announcement, reversing much of yesterday’s fall in yields. Also significant is an uptick in the labor participation rate, to 63.1, up from 62.9, perhaps indicating a rise in employment opportunities for previously “discouraged” workers.  Jobs Report Comes On Top Of Positive SentimentBut overall, the stock market maintained most of its gains immediately following the report. Trading before the jobs number saw equity index futures on the rebound after stocks tanked the day before.Apple Inc. AAPL shares, which had helped drag down the market yesterday, were bouncing along with other tech stocks. Shares of Netflix, Inc. NFLX and Intel Corporation INTC were helping with the positive momentum as they rose following bullish analyst notes.Even yesterday’s beaten-down airline stocks seemed ready to rally. Delta Airlines DAL shares fell nearly 9% yesterday after reporting lower-than-expected revenue growth during the holiday season. In response, United Continental UAL and American Airlines Group AAL slid 5% and 7.5%, respectively. All three airlines were up about 1% in premarket trade today. Still, based on DAL’s results, consider watching whether airline stocks will hit more turbulence as lower fuel prices could create expectations for cheaper flights, which could pressure profits.On the trade front, news that China and the United States have scheduled trade talks in Beijing for Jan. 7-8 was arguably also a positive for stocks. With Apple blaming deteriorating conditions in China for its surprise downward revenue revision, and a top Trump economic adviser telling CNN that other U.S. companies could take a hit until a deal is struck with China, investors may be thinking that pressure is ratcheting up on leaders to resolve their trade differences. Worries over China’s economy have helped drive stock market volatility of late as the trade war between the world’s two largest economies drags on. This week, investors have seen solid evidence of problems in the Chinese economy, with disappointing manufacturing data and Apple’s lower guidance. As Goes Apple …Everything that has mass in the universe has a gravitational pull; the bigger the object, the bigger the pull. That’s why Newton’s apple fell toward the earth.While it wasn’t gravity that pulled Apple down on Thursday, its fall was still precipitous. The iPhone maker’s shares dropped nearly 10% and helped pull down other companies in its orbit. Tech companies were the hardest hit, with that sector the biggest loser in the S&P 500 (SPX).The declines came after AAPL said its revenue for the holiday quarter ended Dec. 29 would be significantly lower than expected amid lower iPhone sales in China as the trade war continues. AAPL and other tech companies are heavily tied to the world’s second largest economy, both for sales of their end-products and for the supply chains that help make those products. AAPL specifically cited the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China, which have dogged Wall Street for months and contributed to the worst year for stocks in a decade in 2018. Disappointing Manufacturing DataBut a declining business climate in China, the world’s second largest economy, isn’t just a drag on tech companies. AAPL’s announcement underscores an increasing worry among investors that global economic growth could be in for a slowdown.The disclosure from AAPL came on the heels of disappointing manufacturing data from China and Europe. A recent index onChina’s manufacturing sector showed contraction for the first time in 19 months. And recent manufacturing data across the eurozone indicated a broad-based slowdown in the region.If that weren’t enough to spook investors about the global economy, a reading on U.S. manufacturing came in weaker than expected on Thursday, also helping to push stocks lower. The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index fell from 59.3 to 54.1 in December. While that still showed expansion, it was a bigger drop than a Briefing.com consensus had expected. Economists there were forecasting the reading to come in at 57.8.That left investors to digest disappointing manufacturing data from three of the world’s key economies even as they were handed a big piece of anecdotal evidence of a potential economic slowing in the form of Apple’s lowered guidance. Risk Appetite Muted on ThursdayMeanwhile, the U.S. budget impasse and partial government shutdown continued, keeping about 800,000 federal workers away from their jobs. It seems likely that the longer those workers remain out of their jobs, the less they will spend and the more pessimistic on the economy they will become. That’s not good news considering recent consumer confidence numbers, which fell more than expected.With all the unease swirling about, investors retreated from stocks and into perceived safe havens. Both gold and the yen climbed, and U.S. government debt yields fell. The 10-year Treasury yield dropped farther away from the psychologically important 3% mark. One thing to consider watching as trading unfolds today: If investors and traders feel confident enough to hold onto riskier positions heading into the weekend, that could bode well for bulls on Monday, but if not then we could see the market give back some of this morning’s gains.Figure 1: Apple and the Market: While correlation doesn’t always mean causation, Apple has often been a market leader, both on the upside and on the downside. Last year, a peak for the stock (purple line) came at roughly the same time as a peak for the S&P 500 (candlestick chart). Recently, both have been falling sharply. Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices Chart source: Thethinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Investors Increasingly Believe in Dovish Fed: As government debt yields slumped amid safe-haven bond buying on Thursday, the 2-year Treasury yield briefly fell below the effective fed funds rate of 2.4% (recall that the Fed has set its target Fed funds rate in a range between 2.25% and 2.5%). That may mean that investors don’t think the central bank will be able to raise rates as much as it has previously telegraphed. The latest from the Fed suggests that policy makers have been considering two interest rates hikes this year. But based on futures activity, the market has its own ideas. Futures are showing about a 6% chance of a cut in the fed funds rate by the March meeting and a greater likelihood of two cuts between now and December than even one hike, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool. It may be worth being cautious with these predictions, however, as they could be setting up the market for disappointment. After all, the U.S. economy is still expanding, and the Fed might end up being more hawkish than the market wants.Earnings Season Coming Up: With all the doom and gloom swirling about the market, it may be easy to forget that 2018 saw some bumper corporate earnings and this upcoming earnings season is expected to also show earnings growth. According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, Q4 2018 earnings per share (EPS) growth is expected to come in at 13.7% while full year 2018 EPS growth is pegged at 22.5%. But as investment research firm CFRA reminds us, S&P 500 companies through Q3 2018 had recorded 27 back-to-back quarters where actual results exceeded end-of quarter estimates. If that happens this upcoming earnings season, investors might have something to cheer about. Happy Job Hunting?: There’s another labor-related economic report on the horizon in the form of the monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report. The labor turnover report focuses on job availability, along with hiring and separation trends such as retirement. What might matter most for this report is “voluntary quits,” meaning workers who have the confidence to leave a job for what they believe will be a better one. Keep in mind that the upcoming report is for November, so even if people were confident enough to leave their jobs then – perhaps in hopes of making more money at a new job as the new year approached – that might be reflective of stronger sentiment than what we have now. Still, it could be interesting to see how confident people were in finding a new job even with the tight labor market, especially in light of today’s monster jobs report.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

3,4,AAPL,American Shippers And Carriers React To Signs Of Economic Slowdown,https://www.benzinga.com/node/12938837,"The first week of 2019 saw three of America's largest companies announce revenue expectation reductions, signaling a potential cooling of the U.S. shipping market.Leading the corporations is Apple Inc. AAPL, which announced its revenue for the end of 2018 would be lower than expected due to poor sales in China. This is the first time in 16 years that Apple has lowered its revenue expectations. The news prompted a selloff of Apple and other China-exposed stocks, including General Motors GM.Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL announced its unit revenue (revenue per each seat mile flown) would not meet its 3.5 percent growth target for the fourth quarter of 2018. Delta shares fell roughly nine percent on Thursday, joining Southwest Airlines Co. LUV and American Airlines Inc. AAL, whose share prices declined during December 2018.One reason for the airlines' poor stock market performance is oil prices. Air carriers adjusted their fares and fees while cutting unprofitable flights in response to increasing crude prices in the first half of 2018 when they topped out at $86 per barrel. However, crude prices have since declined to roughly $56 per barrel, which historically prompts airlines to forgo extra profits to compete by lowering fares. This reduces investor interest in the market sector.  FedEx Corporation FDX also reduced its 2019 earning guidance from around $17 per share to roughly $15-$16 per share. Shares of FedEx declined by 3.7 percent on Thursday and were down in 2018. FedEx CEO Frederick Smith blamed the cut in earnings expectations on domestic tax issues, labeling discrepancies with Brexit, the immigration crisis in Germany, the state-centered nature of the Chinese economy, and unilateral tariffs imposed by the United States. Don't miss it. Register today.""Most of the issues that we are dealing with today are induced by bad political choices,"" Smith said during FedEx's fourth quarter earnings call. ""So you just go down the list and they are all things that have created a macroeconomic slowdown.""CNBC analyst Jim Cramer concurred that entering China for American companies carries risk. He also agreed that the European market was slowing due to the trade implications of Brexit.The Institute for Supply Management found discouraging figures in American manufacturing. Between November and December, the factory activity index dropped by 5.2 percent from 59.3 to 54.1, the largest monthly decrease since the 2008 financial crisis. New factory orders dropped to 51.1 from 62.1, an 11 percent decline. When the index is above 50 percent, it indicates that the market for manufacturing is still growing, but the steep drop is troubling.FreightWaves SONAR examines orders for durable goods excluding transportation. The market's lowest point since 2014 has been $141,619 million. By August 2018 that figure had grown by over 16 percent, reaching $164,643 million. The second half of 2018 saw orders plateau, indicating a slowdown of manufactured goods.Manufacturing accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy and roughly eight percent of the American workforce. The factory employment index also fell by 2.2 percent from 58.4 to 56.2.Consumer spending is also showing signs of weakness as the Consumer Confidence Index decreased from 136.4 in November to 128.1 in December.One positive economic sign going into 2019 is the recent jobs report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today that the U.S. added 312,000 new jobs in December. Additionally, average hourly earnings rose 84 cents, or 3.2 percent, for 2018. Meanwhile, unemployment rose to 3.9 percent, signifying more Americans are entering the job market.These gains are speculated to buoy consumer spending and delay the predicted economic slowdown.Want more content like this?

4,5,AAPL,"TD Ameritrade IMX Continued Its Dip In December, Falling To A More Than Two-Year Low",https://www.benzinga.com/node/12953011,"Declining for the third month in a row, TD Ameritrade’s December Investor Movement Index (IMX) fell to a more than two-year low of 4.41 over the course of December. This is more than 16 percent below November’s reading of 5.27 and marks the steepest drop in the broker’s regular survey of investor behavior since February.The results are not entirely surprising, after the market weathered its worst month in a decade. However, despite the beating the equity market took in the waning days of 2018, which caused most investors in the survey to sell, TDA clients were still net buyers of financial assets overall.Blue Chip DiscountsWhile December saw a flood of selling pressure in the largest, highest profile names on the market, there were also plenty of buyers at the bottom looking to get in cheap on some of the most heavily punished blue chip stocks. Financials were a huge part of that theme. While Bank of America Inc. BAC and JP Morgan Chase Inc. JPM both found themselves down by between 13-14 percent on the month, both were popular choices among TDA clients. Similarly, Warren Buffett’s holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-B) was also net bought on the month after falling about 15 percent from its December entry, but climbed within 7.5 percent in 2018’s final week of trading.Other appealing discounts appeared in tech and telecom. Despite lowering their guidance and voicing pessimism on both domestic and Chinese iPhone sales, the attention Apple Inc. AAPL received from TDA clients was a net positive. AT&T Inc. T, which received analyst nods as it went live with the first 5G data network, and Amazon Inc. AMZN, which reported record number of items sold over the holidays, also proved strong buying prospects for investors.Risked OutWhile some heavily hit stocks received a second look from investors, others weren’t so lucky as their risks overshadowed any potential upside. Energy concern Duke Energy Corporation DUK was among them as energy prices continued their free fall in the month.Volatile names in the biotech industry like Pfizer Inc. PFE and Tesaro Inc. TSRO were net sold through the month, though Tesaro achieved new highs following an acquisition announcement from GlaxoSmithKline plc GSK, which profit-taking contributed to selling.However, the companies that truly emerged as the most susceptible to dramatic shocks to their equity were embattled social media companies Facebook Inc. FB and Twitter Inc. TWTR. While both were net sold by TDA clients over the month, with Twitter being singled out by notorious short seller Andrew Left, December marked yet another month of controversy, bad press, and boycotts for Facebook, although some analysts remain bullish. Also sold in the month were Alibaba Group Holdings BABA, Procter & Gamble Co. PG and Starbucks Corporation SBUX, which made its fourth consecutive appearance in the IMX as a net sold name.For a complete breakdown of TD Ameritrade's IMX as well as a historical look at the index, you can read the full report here.",2019-01-08
5,6,AAPL,Apple CEO Tim Cook Talks With Jim Cramer—Here Are The Key Takeaways,https://www.benzinga.com/node/12957963,"Apple Inc. AAPL CEO Tim Cook spoke with CNBC's Jim Cramer in an interview aired Tuesday evening covering multiple topics from Apple's services business, China concerns, Wall Street ""naysayers"" and more.What To Expect In 2019Investors and Apple enthusiasts will be treated to ""material"" new additions to its services in 2019, the CEO told Cramer. Cook didn't offer any specific details aside from a focus on health care, but said it relates to technologies the company has been working on ""for multiple years.""Non-Flagship RevenueApple collected $100 billion in revenue from products and services that don't directly come from the iPhone, Cook said. Some of the business lines include the App Store, iTunes, Apple Pay and cloud services which combined for 19 percent growth in the recent quarter. Looking forward to the end of 2020, the company expects to double its non-flagship revenue base from current levels.See Also: 'Jaw-Dropping': Wall Street Reacts To Apple's Guidance Cut, China BusinessChina Trade Deal 'Needs To Be Updated'The trade agreement between U.S. and China ""needs to be updated"" and Cook is ""very optimistic"" an agreement can be made. The world relies on a ""strong U.S. and China for the world economy to be strong.""A resolved trade agreement will ""clearly be good"" for the American economy but perhaps more important for the ""world in general.""Street Analysts Underappreciate The BusinessAnalysts are making a mistake in not fully appreciating Apple's business, which is powered by a growing ecosystem of both devices and services. Behind the company's line of products is a ""culture of innovation"" that satisfies the many wants and needs of the ""incredible, loyal customers.""Cook doesn't particularly pay attention to analysts who are focused to much on the near term. The market is ""quite emotional"" when viewing Apple through a small time period and the company ""sort of look[s] through all of that.""""The product pipeline has never been better,"" Cook said. ""The ecosystem has never been stronger. The services are on a tear.""6 TakeawaysLoup Ventures' Gene Munster, a former Wall Street analyst that covered Apple, said in a blog post there are six main takeaways from Cook's interview.
Cook's commentary of new services launch in 2019 is inline with expectations and could come from a relaunch of the digital magazine service Texture which Apple bought in 2018. Other launches will be focus on a combination of hardware and software related to health care.
Cook is optimistic a resolution to the U.S.-China trade war will be seen soon.
Apple is likely ""doubling down"" on trade in offers of old iPhone models. Munster said if the promotion were to end, Cook would have ""avoided the topic"" in the interview.
Cook's comments that the Apple Watch represents 5 percent of sales and growing at 45 percent while Air Pods represents 1 percent of sales and growing at 87 percent is consistent with estimates.
Cook expressed a dedication to grow its business in India through producing iPhones in the country and opening new stores.
Apple believes it has an upperhand in its legal battles with Qualcomm, Inc. QCOM, which operates unlawfully by charging ""exorbitant"" prices.

6,7,AAPL,"Watching The Clock: Trade Talks End With Optimism, But Deadline Draws Closer",https://www.benzinga.com/node/12958812,"Trade talks are over for this week, and now it’s clock-watching time as the U.S. and China have just about six-and-a-half more weeks to settle their differences. While the market seems to have a positive tone early on, one note of caution is that there’s still a lot to get done in a short period.This week’s talks didn’t conclude with any major breakthroughs, but words from both sides make it sound like the discussions were constructive. The fact that an extra day was added might be a sign that negotiators were making some kind of progress. U.S. negotiators told the media that the talks went “just fine,” while China called the talks, “serious.” Probably no one expected anything really significant to come out of these meetings, so just hearing a positive tone appeared to give investors some confidence.However, the hope is that more progress can be made pretty quickly, because it’s unclear how much longer the market and the economy can handle this big gray area on trade. The extra day was a great sign that the two sides seriously want to get something done, but let’s see if they build on that quickly.Looking for Clues in Fed MinutesWith the trade talk drama over for now, anyone seeking more drama might get their fill this afternoon when Fed minutes for December hit the tape, possibly offering more insight into the recent rate increase. At this point, the futures market indicates that could be the last hike for a while, but, as noted below, the Fed itself might not be perfectly aligned with market anticipation. One thing to consider looking for in the minutes is any talk about specific signals Fed officials might be watching as they plan strategy. The Fed has said it would be data dependent, but do some data matter more than others? How can the Fed walk the tightrope between struggling emerging markets and a U.S. economy that still seems strong for the most part? Maybe the minutes can provide some clarity. It might also be worth checking the minutes for any discussion about balance sheet reduction. Fed Chair Jerome Powell appeared to help send stocks lower the day of the meeting when he indicated that the Fed wouldn’t change its policy of reducing the balance sheet, a strategy that could theoretically lead to higher interest rates. Then last week, Powell offered a refresh, saying the Fed would tweak the balance sheet program if necessary.All that said, it seems unlikely that the minutes will show investors a lot that they don’t already know, but it never hurts to take a look.The Fed could be in the news even before minutes get released, as several Fed speakers have speeches scheduled earlier today.Also in the news: No word of progress on the U.S. government shutdown. However, the president has invited congressional leadership to the White House today, media reports said. If progress does get made, there’s a chance it could provide a boost for the market, mainly because Wall Street dislikes uncertainty. However, the current shutdown seems to be providing more evidence that shutdowns don’t typically have much negative impact on the stock market. Mini Winning Streak Continues for S&P 500Tuesday marked the third-straight day of gains for the S&P 500 (SPX), which is now up nearly 10% from its closing low on Christmas Eve. It’s the first three-day win streak for the SPX since late November, and the SPX has now risen in five of the last six sessions. Still, some analysts remain cautious, noting that emerging markets haven’t shown much spark lately. Some of the so-called “leading indicator” sectors like transports and semiconductors haven’t been able to keep up with the SPX, either (see chart below), and the financial sector didn’t participate in Tuesday’s gains. A turnaround in those sectors might indicate increased hope that a global economic slowdown isn’t imminent. The continued rally this week in crude, now up seven days in a row, does seem to signal some economic optimism.Some of the Street’s strength this week might be more attributable to individual company developments instead of widespread improvement in sentiment. For instance, shares of Union Pacific UNP had their best day in a decade after the company appointed a new COO and received an analyst upgrade. Shares rose more than 8%. That was a bright spot for a transport sector down 16% over the last three months. Another factor in the rebound this week might simply be recovery from what some investors might have seen as oversold conditions, Briefing.com noted.That said, small-caps—which some economists see as a leading indicator—continued to perform well Tuesday, and some of the FAANGs appear to be back on the prowl amid optimism about China trade negotiations. Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN got a lift this week in part from positive Wall Street analyst chatter about the company. Apple Inc. AAPL, whose shares have been battered and bruised for months, showed a bit of its old swagger Tuesday after CEO Tim Cook made some positive comments. Facebook Inc. FB also had a good day. However, shares of AAPL might continue to face pressure if China’s economic data fail to impress. On that note, Samsung Electronics SSNLF said this week that it expects its quarterly operating profit to fall amid weak demand for chips and heavy smartphone competition. It’s not hard to read between the lines and figure that, like AAPL, Samsung might be catching a cold from China, an important market for its chips.Still, the trade optimism might have been a factor helping stocks like Boeing Co. BA and Caterpillar Inc. CAT on Tuesday, as both of those industrial names continue to reflect—at least to some extent—investors’ optimism or pessimism about tariffs. Earnings Murmur From HousingThough earnings season doesn’t get started in a big way until next week, there were murmurs from the earnings front today. Most notably, homebuilder Lennar Corporation LEN said its Q4 earnings per share beat Wall Street analysts’ estimates but it missed analysts’ estimates on revenue and new home deliveries. The company said slowing sales had to do with rising mortgage rates and home prices. That probably encapsulates the struggles of the housing industry, and it’s something we might hear more of from other homebuilding companies as earnings continue. Crude continues to show strength, and that’s possibly a good sign for economic growth even if it does give inflation bugs a chance to voice worries. Energy is the greatest contributor to inflation. Still, at just around $50 a barrel, U.S. crude remains on the cheap end of the recent scale, below its levels from most of last year. Anyway, crude has risen seven days in a row, so we’ll see if Wednesday makes it eight.Figure 1: Transports Can’t Keep Pace: The Dow Jones Transportation Average (candlestick) hasn’t been able to gain as quickly as the S&P 500 (purple line) over the last few days, as this five-day chart shows. Transports can be a leading indicator of economic health, so bullish investors might want to watch and see if transports can pull ahead in coming weeks. Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Don’t Overlook the Small Guy: We don’t often talk about small business in this column. But maybe we should, considering small businesses provide the majority of jobs in the U.S. That’s why the NFIB Small Business Optimism report for December showing that these companies continue to create new positions and seek new applicants could be worth a deeper look. According to the organization, the net percent of owners expecting better business conditions in six months and the percent viewing the current period as a good time to expand have both tapered off since record highs last summer, but remain well above their historical averages. Actual hiring strengthened to the highest reading in six months, job openings are at a record high levels, and plans to create new jobs are down only three points from August’s record high. All this could be good news from a consumer demand standpoint. However, there’s one thing that might trigger some inflation jitters: A record 39% of small business owners reported job openings they could not fill in the current period, the NFIB said. When businesses have trouble finding employees, they sometimes have to dig deeper into their pockets, and the costs can get passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices.Minute by Minute: Some of the volatility this week appears to be based on anticipation ahead of Fed minutes this afternoon. While it could be interesting to read the report and be a fly on the wall at the Fed’s December meeting, it’s questionable how big the market impact might be from the minutes themselves. If the last three Fed minutes releases are any guide, there just hasn’t been too big a reaction on Wall Street. The S&P 500 Index (SPX) fell about one point when minutes were released in August, less than one point when minutes came out in October, and six points when minutes were released in November. While past isn’t necessarily precedent, it seems like at least in late 2018, investors didn’t get too excited by whatever they saw in those Fed minutes reports. That doesn’t mean there never is a reaction. Back in July, the SPX rose more than 20 points after investors saw minutes from the June meeting. However, these reports might lose some of their impact now that all Fed meetings are going to be followed by Fed Chair press conferences. Market, Fed Still at Odds: Recent comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell seemed to reassure investors that the Fed plans to be patient in its policy. It was lack of that reassurance from Powell that arguably helped send investors fleeing for the exits after the last Fed meeting. However, before feeling too reassured, investors might want to keep in mind that the Fed and the market still seem to be looking at two different scenarios for the year ahead. According to the last Fed “dot plot,” policy makers still anticipate two rate hikes in 2019. The futures market projects two fewer than that. This dichotomy could be a sign of policy makers having more on their minds than simply the weak market action of the last three months. They have to review all aspects of the economy. Consider this: What if the government shutdown gets solved in the near-term and the two U.S. political parties start working in a more bipartisan manner on infrastructure spending? It may sound unlikely, but politicians on both sides have advocated infrastructure spending. At the same time, there’s starting to be more optimism that China and the U.S. can possibly solve some of their issues. Combine that with hourly pay rising 3.2% over the last year, and suddenly you might be looking at some inflation concerns coming back into the picture. If this scenario happens, the Fed could find itself back in a tricky situation of having to consider coming through on those dot plot projections even though the market is looking for steady rates.

7,9,AAPL,TD Ameritrade's Investor Movement Index Highlights Grim Grinning Outlook For 2019,https://www.benzinga.com/node/12960171,"Few investors would argue 2018 was a good year for their portfolios. No one would argue that it was better than 2017. A historical look at TD Ameritrade’s Investor Movement Index (IMX) paints a fairly stark portrait of just how much worse last year was than its predecessor.Turns out, that gut check is more true than many might realize. The December 2018 release of the IMX, which tracks buying and selling behavior among the broker’s 11 million retail clients, posted its lowest score in more than two years at 4.41. That score is also within a tenth of its all-time low of 4.33, which it hit in March 2016.Compare that to the December 2017’s IMX report, which marked the index’s all-time high of 8.59.While there’s plenty of reasons underlying the difference in performance between the two years, the sheer rate of the drop each December bookends is worth closer scrutiny.First, A RecapEven a cursory glance at the historical IMX chart reveals the tide shifted quickly entering the new year. Following the December 2017 peak, there was a massive drawdown of nearly 10 percent in January as market leaders like Apple Inc. AAPL and Facebook, Inc. FB started to flounder, both ending the month in the red.Then the February correction hit, which drove both the broad market down 10.2 percent and sent the IMX down more than 23.5 percent.As volatility lingered, so did the investor pessimism. The IMX gradually shaved off points in both March and April, hitting a low of 4.79. April’s low reading was the first time the index had fallen below 5 since 2016.Then, like the market, the IMX spent the summer steadily building back the gains it had lost in Q1. By late August, the S&P 500 managed to retake new highs while, in September, the IMX managed to top its February level.Which brings the story to Q4 2018.Driven by a conglomeration of interest rate fears, anxiety over trade and evidence of slowing long-term growth from Nasdaq tech leaders like Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and the aforementioned Apple, the market’s volatile October, November and December ended up wiping out the entire year’s gains. The fallout didn’t manifest on the survey until November and December, which saw two consecutive 0.8 point drops, something that seemed rare back when it happened in January.2018 Post-MortemOne of the most telling aspects when comparing 2018’s investor activity to that of 2017 is the number of dramatic rises and falls between IMX data points. While 2017 only saw one 10-percent jump between October and November, the 2018 IMX fell by at least 10 percent four times, in February and March and again in November and December.These movements generally align, and even occasionally preceded, sympathetic trends in the broad market, with late 2017’s 15 percent IMX spike seemingly anticipating the December/January market rally.However, a more compelling correlation appears when Comparing the IMX to CBOE’s Volatility index (VIX). Taken this way, the 15-percent gain the index saw in late 2017 and subsequent +10 percent movements in the index anticipated the drastic swings in the market in the following weeks and months.While the investor optimism that manifested as a 15-percent spike in the IMX’s reading could be seen as a indicator of the market’s subsequent rally in December and January, it may be more accurately seen as forecasting the return of volatility as 2018 rolled on.What It Means For 2019The increased frequency of 10-percent shifts in a sentiment indicator like the IMX might be the most valuable piece of information investors look at when considering what the months ahead hold.The sharply negative November and December 2018 IMX readings might reveal a period of good equity performance, something already starting to manifest in the heart of January.The continued shifts in investor sentiment, however, might more accurately forecast continued volatility into the near future. Given the dramatic gaps between the months, there’s still a good chance volatility might creep back in again until investor activity becomes more stable month-to-month.Interpreting the signals in the IMX is up to each investor, but the whims of the market will have the ultimate say.",2019-01-09
8,10,AAPL,"Stung By Poor Fiscal Q2 Print, FedEx Executives Look To Guide Analysts Toward Better Times",https://www.benzinga.com/node/12968719,"Top FedEx Corp. FDX executives met with securities analysts yesterday in an effort to convince them the issues that led to mid-December's mediocre fiscal second quarter results and downbeat fiscal 2019 outlook were being rapidly addressed. For their part, analysts caught off-guard by the company's disappointing forecast appear willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.The meeting, held at FedEx's Memphis headquarters, had been scheduled back in October. But The events of the past three weeks lent it greater resonance and urgency than could have been expected. The group came armed with a list of concerns ranging from the core worry--how quickly FedEx could turn around its troubled TNT Express unit--to demanding, in the name of greater transparency, they be allowed to verbally pose questions on the quarterly calls rather than submit them only via e-mail. Five members of the company's upper management echelon were on hand, with one notable exception: Chairman and CEO Fred Smith, who was believed to be meeting with mutual fund managers elsewhere in the building.At the meeting, Brie Carere, FedEx's new chief marketing officer, confirmed the company will enter the home delivery market for large and heavy goods. According to analysts, Carere said FedEx successfully beta-tested the product, through its FedEx Freight less-than-truckload unit, in six U.S. markets over the holidays. Executives wouldn't give a timeline for a broad rollout. However, Bascome Majors, analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group, surmised in a note that the company would ""scale this effort rapidly."" FedEx's strong exposure to the retail and e-commerce customer segment, combined with FedEx Freight's cross-dock network, ""should instantly offer a credible solution for customers"" in a segment currently dominated by XPO Logistics Inc. XPO and J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., JBHT Majors wrote. Hunt announced yesterday that it had acquired Cory 1st Choice Home Delivery for $100 million to penetrate the last-mile segment for furniture deliveries.FedEx blamed the subpar results and weak outlook on a confluence of factors, among them a dramatically slowing European economy which hampered TNT Express' business, the mid-2017 ""NotPetya"" cyber-attack on TNT Express systems, a less-profitable mix at the unit that was weighted towards heavier-weighted traffic and away from higher-margin express business, and the effects of the U.S-China trade war which led to a slowing in trans-Pacific business and shipping activity; Apple Inc., AAPL for example, is one of FedEx's largest customers.At the meeting, executives vowed to take fast action to fix TNT Express. However, only about 30 percent of the TNT Express business has been integrated, and most of that has involved smaller, less complex initiatives. Todd C. Fowler, analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said the mix among TNT Express' smaller customers remains ""sub-optimal,"" though it has regained lost share from most larger shippers. ""Our impression is some temporary, manual network adjustments are taking place to provide improved service at a competitive cost, with further traction expected as additional countries are integrated in the coming quarters,"" Fowler wrote. Don't miss it. Register today.The FedEx Ground and Freight operations continue to perform well, company executives told analysts. Ground volumes can double without the need for an additional hub to process the increased traffic, analysts were told. Ground margins should reach the mid-teen levels, and freight margins should rise to double-digit levels both by fiscal year 2020, wrote Amit Mehrotra, a Deutsche Bank analyst. LTL margins should expand as the cost of I.T. investments recedes and pricing strengthens to reflect the impact of stronger volumes, Mehrotra added. The ground and LTL divisions account for two-thirds of the company's profits. The laggard is the company's core Express unit, where TNT Express resides.The FedEx executives avoided making hard-and-fast projections because the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, the analysts noted. For example, executives would not offer guidance on when FedEx Express would achieve a $1.7 billion profit improvement over FY 2017 levels; the company said last month that it would hit that target in FY 2020, which begins June 1. Executives also stated that future capital-investment plans remained under review.The consensus among analysts at the meeting is that traders and investors have priced in all the bad news, and that valuations are so reasonable that the company's board should strongly consider repurchasing its stock. According to Fowler, the company has 6.3 million shares, or about 2 to 3 percent of its existing float, authorized for repurchase.Mehrotra said FedEx shares trade at single-digit multiples and sit at their largest discount to the S&P 500 in its history. After taking a $23 a share drubbing on Dec. 19, the first trading day after posting the results, the share price drifted down to a 52-week intra-day low of $150.94 the day after Christmas. Shares have risen nearly $20 since then.As for the push towards greater investor transparency, FedEx will restore its traditional practice on its next quarterly call of allowing analysts to pose questions by phone.Want more content like this?

9,11,AAPL,"Another Day, Another Bank Misses On Earnings: Market Could Be On Defensive",https://www.benzinga.com/node/12986104,"Big bank earnings might get overshadowed a bit Tuesday by international events, including a key vote on Brexit and a possible China stimulus plan. Still, earnings remain front and center as a full set of major firms open their books today.Also front and center is the U.S. government shutdown. Corporate executives are starting to warn that failure to resolve it quickly could weigh on both company results and the overall economy.JP Morgan Chase Sees Slower Trading, Hurting ResultsFor the second day in a row, a big bank reported slower trading Tuesday. This time it was JP Morgan Chase JPM, which missed analysts’ earnings projections for the first time in 15 quarters as bond trading in Q4 came in well below third-party estimates. The bank reported earnings per share of $1.98, compared with third-party consensus estimate of $2.25. Shares slipped 2% in the pre-market hours.Keep in mind, however, that despite the trading miss, JPM’s overall profit rose 67% in Q4, so we’ll see if Wall Street takes a breather when investors start digging into the numbers. Before JPM reported, futures trading had pointed higher. That changed rather quickly, however, and some indices turned negative.The earnings miss doesn’t mean all is necessarily out of sorts at JPM, however. Remember, as with Citigroup’s C miss on Q4 revenue yesterday, JPM was hit with weak trading in Q4, and that colored overall results. Investment banking revenue and net income both climbed at JPM, the bank said. Revenue of $26.8 billion, however, was a bit shy of third-party estimates. A second big bank reported Tuesday, with Wells Fargo & Co. WFC slightly beating third-party consensus estimates. Shares were about flat in pre-market trading ahead of the opening bell.As typical with bank earnings, the numbers only compose part of the story. Comments today from JPM CEO Jamie Dimon could get close attention from investors, who tend to listen carefully to Dimon’s analysis of the U.S. and global economy. He recently said, “2019 could be the fastest global growth year on record,” although he did mention that a slowdown in 2020 seemed likely. On Tuesday, Dimon urged the U.S. government to end its partial shutdown, saying the shutdown could significantly reduce economic growth this quarter if it continues.Delta Cites Government Shutdown PressureAnother stock retreating a little early on was Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, which beat analysts’ earnings estimates but appeared to disappoint with its guidance. This came after competitor American Airlines Group In. AAL cut guidance last week, and might lead to more questions about the health of the airline industry. In its press release, DAL cited “increasing currency headwinds and the ongoing government shutdown” as challenges. In its call, the company said the shutdown is costing it $25 million a month because of government contractors and officials who aren’t traveling.Also on the earnings front early Tuesday, shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH rose after beating earnings projections and maintaining its outlook. Health care was a strong sector in Q4, and UNH is the first major health company to report so far this season.China Stimulus Hopes, Brexit in Focus Overseas, comments by China’s premier that raised hopes for a possible fiscal stimulus appeared to help Asian stocks and boost crude Tuesday. It looks like China might try to stimulate demand by cutting taxes. Details are awaited.A little closer to home, there’s a Brexit vote in England tonight where Parliament is scheduled to vote on a bill supported by Prime Minister Theresa May. News reports suggest the bill has little chance of passing. If the deal fails, May needs to come up with something new pretty quickly with the March 29 deadline looming. Failure to approve a Brexit plan by then would probably result in a “no-deal” Brexit, and no one is really sure what the economic consequences might be.For investors, the vote puts more focus on overnight trading Tuesday after the closing bell on Wall Street. Results of the vote could start to filter in around 10 p.m. ET, and it’s possible we could see some volatility around then. In another overseas development, Germany’s economy saw its weakest growth in five years last year.On the data front, December U.S. producer prices looked pretty benign, falling 0.2%. That was a little more than analysts had expected.Forgive and Forget?Last quarter, the market seemed geared up to punish any company that disappointed even a bit. Perhaps now, with earnings season just underway, the tide is turning toward forgiveness.Exhibit One might be Citigroup C, which reported weaker than expected revenue Monday. Initially, shares fell, but the stock bounced back in a big way, climbing 4% by late in the session as investors appeared more focused on the company’s progress cutting costs and growing its loan business. If C can be forgiven, perhaps that bodes well for the other big banks—especially those like Goldman Sachs Inc. GS and Morgan Stanley MS–which rely more on their trading businesses. We’ll see whether they get similar treatment if they come out with weak trading revenues like C did. GS reports Wednesday followed by MS on Thursday.One thing seems pretty clear if you’ve followed the market for a few years: We need to see financials start leading the way. It was refreshing on Monday, a day when interest rates weren’t going crazy and when C reported its revenue miss, to see financials get a breath of fresh air and basically be one of the only sectors solidly in the green. This doesn’t just look good for the banks, but potentially for the market as a whole. There’s an old adage that it’s hard to have a rally without the financials, and they were basically absent most of last year.Speaking of interest rates, the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield seems, well, unyielding. It’s been stuck right around 2.71% for several days. That’s well above recent lows under 2.6%, but still way under last fall’s 3.2% highs. At the same time, the 10-year has expanded its slight premium to the two-year note, with that gap now around 18 basis points. A year ago, that might have seemed very narrow. However, it’s certainly a decent jump from the single-digit premium it had a few weeks back that had some investors worried about the “curve” perhaps going inverted. It’s still a possibility, but there hasn’t been a re-test of the narrowest gap.Volatility is likely to remain a big factor in the weeks to come, but for now it seems to have settled down a bit. The VIX—which is the most well-known “fear indicator”—stayed below 20 on Monday, near one-month lows. Sometimes earnings season is actually a source of stability, because it can give the market a sense of being moored. Geopolitical pressures, while still a major factor, might step out of the spotlight a bit as company results take the stage. Could Shutdown Weigh on Airlines?With both Delta DAL and United Continental UAL reporting today, airlines could get some attention. It might be interesting to see if the government shutdown starts to affect airlines, in part because there’s a chance it could cause a worse client experience due to possible delays. Most business travelers will probably have to keep flying no matter what, but if the shutdown continues, it raises questions about whether the average person who might normally fly to see their aunt and uncle might decide to drive instead. With that in mind, investors might want to hear what airline executives have to say this reporting season about the shutdown’s possible impact on ticket sales, as well as how big their government contracts might be.There’s little apparent change early this week surrounding the shutdown and the China trade situation. Though the news on both fronts is thin, either or both could jump back into the headlines at any given time. So could news about Brexit, where there’s still no deal with only a little over two months until the deadline to resolve issues. If a “no-deal” Brexit starts to seem imminent, there’s a chance it could send U.S. Treasury yields lower and the dollar higher as investors seek possible defensive fortifications outside of Europe.Netflix Outpacing FAANG Peers As Earnings ApproachNetflix NFLX is scheduled to be the first FAANG to report, with results due after the close Thursday. Right now, the stock appears to be showing some momentum, and that’s more than can be said for some of its FAANG stablemates like Apple AAPL and Facebook FB. The NFLX strength could be partly due to enthusiasm over its hit movie Bird Box. When your product becomes a cultural phenomenon, that’s never a bad thing.The company got an analyst upgrade Monday, and investors are probably bracing for the latest batch of subscribership numbers when NFLX reports. Competition might be out there, with Comcast Corporation CMCSA getting into the streaming game, so we’ll have to see how that plays out over time. At this point, however, NFLX is arguably the king of the hill in its industry, so everyone could be coming after them.Other FAANG stocks just don’t seem to have the same edge right now as they used to, though AAPL got an analyst upgrade Monday. Along with the upgrade came advice to AAPL from the analyst that the company might want to consider lowering prices in China. We’ll see if they take that advice. They do have three new phones coming out, so there is a lot of news bubbling around. Still, when you look at analyst recommendations overall for the FAANGS, it’s interesting to note that AAPL now resides at the bottom of the list, meaning its stock has by far the fewest buy ratings. Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN currently leads the pack in that respect, followed by a tie between FB and Alphabet GOOG. If “pack” is the right word to describe how the FAANGs traded the last two years, it now looks like spring has come to the Arctic. The FAANG pack is breaking up, with different stocks going different directions. This could make it a little tougher to get a read on the overall market. A year ago, it was easy to say that if the FAANGs were up, their momentum would often spread to most of tech and beyond that to other sectors. If they continue heading in different directions, the compass might have lost its needle.Figure 1: Mixed Signals: This one-month chart of copper (candlestick) vs. crude (purple line) tracks two commodities that some analysts point to as possible economic indicators, meaning they tend to rise and fall based on the health of the underlying economy. At this point, they’re sending mixed signals, with crude up sharply since the Christmas Eve lows but copper failing to show much strength. Both could be worth tracking in coming weeks amid worries about the Chinese growth picture. Data Source: CME Group. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  Body Language: It’s probably no coincidence that stocks came under pressure on the first day of earnings season. Many investors are worried not only about the numbers, but about what executives might say. The market dived in Q4 despite a roaring Q3 earnings season where average S&P 500 earnings climbed more than 20%. You can chalk that up partially to bearish guidance and a cautious tone from many companies as the economy slowed worldwide, and some of those same fears continue to haunt the market now. Maybe that could ease based on what bank executives say this week. Things got started on a positive note when Citigroup C CFO John Gerspach told reporters in a call Monday that the “real economy” is doing well, though he’s worried about how what he calls the “financial economy” will react to the continued unwinding of quantitative easing.There’s also the numbers themselves, which are starting to face more difficult year-over-year comparisons. For instance, research firm CFRA expects 12.1% EPS growth for Q4 and just 5.6% growth for all of 2019. Those Q4 expectations have fallen from around 10% a few weeks ago, but remember, there’s a long history of analysts’ early-season predictions getting outpaced by the actual numbers. We’ll have to wait and see if that happens again. CFRA expects every sector except utilities and staples to post earnings gains for Q4, and for the biggest gains to come in energy, financials, and industrials.Proxy Pox: The utilities sector is one often cited as ""defensive"" — that is, a place to hide when volatility rears its head. It's also referred to as a ""bond proxy"" — meaning a sector full of companies with long histories of solid, stable earnings, to the point that the return profiles look similar to those of many fixed income investments. Monday's weakness in the sleepy utilities sector, led by bankruptcy talk in PG&E Corporation PCG, one of the nation's top utility companies, should serve as a reminder that utility stocks are still stocks, subject to the same risks of any stock, including the risk of bankruptcy, which typically wipes out most, if not all the equity in common shares. Monday's 2.5% move down in the utilities sector wasn't just limited to PCG, which lost nearly half its market cap yesterday. Other utility biggies, such as NextEra Energy Inc. NEE and Dominion Energy Inc. D—which together comprise about 20% of the S&P 500 Utilities Sector—were off well over 2% on the session. Other sector heavyweights such as Exelon Corporation EXC and Duke Energy Corporation DUK fell on the news as well.Crude and Copper Watch: Speaking of “proxies,” two of the most closely followed economic proxies are crude and copper. Both could be worth watching in coming weeks as concerns about China’s economy and the U.S./China tariff battle continue to be front and center. Back in early 2016, the last time China went through a rough patch, crude became very closely correlated with the stock market. That seems to be happening again. Since the U.S. stock market hit new lows on Christmas Eve, crude is up about 20% (even with Monday’s slump factored in) and stocks are up around 9%. At this juncture, it looks like the stock market might be taking its cues from crude, with some investors figuring if crude prices rise, demand (and the global economy) can’t be doing all that bad. On the other hand, copper—a widely used industrial metal, especially in the electricity sector—might be telling  a different story, and it’s also worth watching. The price of copper futures is actually down a few cents since Dec. 24, and only a smidgen above the one-year lows posted last summer. If copper continues to languish, that could be a sign that China’s economy is starting to affect industrial demand, potentially indicating tough sledding ahead for stock markets globally.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

10,12,AAPL,"Market Has A Lot To Digest Amid Brexit News, China Stimulus, Bank Earnings",https://www.benzinga.com/node/12993471,"Investors have plenty to digest this morning as their plates are full with the continuing earnings season as the entree, served with a side of news from overseas that could touch on global economic growth.Bank earnings continued to roll in. Bank of America BAC beat expectations on its top and bottom line as the bank says it benefited from corporate tax relief and rising interest rates. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs GS also beat revenue and profit expectations, and it was notable that a gain in equities trading revenue offset a decline in bond trading revenue.That contrasts with JP Morgan Chase’s JPM and Citigroup’s C performance. JPM on Tuesday became the second big bank in a row to report slower trading after C missed on Q4 revenue Monday. Broken Brexit?As earnings season continued, investors were also digesting the news from yesterday that lawmakers in Britain rejected their prime minister’s plan for the nation’s exit of the European Union. Failure to approve a Brexit plan by March 29 could result in a “no-deal” Brexit, and no one is really sure what the economic consequences might be. A no-confidence vote is expected later today. As the turmoil across the pond continued, stocks seemed to be taking it in stride, arguablybecause news reports had already suggested the Brexit bill had little chance of passing. More broadly, the market may have already priced in European political uncertainty to an extent and would need more definitive headlines about whether there will definitely be a no-deal exit or not before moving sharply. China StimulusIn a fresh sign that Beijing is moving to shore up the Chinese economy, the nation’s central bank on Wednesday made an approximately $83 billion cash injection into the economy. The move followed comments by China’s premier that raised hopes for possible fiscal stimulus and added to optimism during Tuesday’s trading.Worries about China’s economy, the world’s second largest, have been mounting recently as the market has seen signs that the economy there could be stumbling, notably in the form of recent data on manufacturing. On the trade front, Sen. Chuck Grassley told reporters that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer didn’t see progress on key issues last week in talks between the two nations, according to media reports. The news flow about the trade war between the world’s two largest economies, whether bullish or bearish, has kept the market on an emotional roller coaster for months amid worries that the dispute could crimp global economic growth. Netflix Entertains MarketThe communication services sector and the information technology sector were among the best performers on Tuesday. With the 2018 reorganization of the telecom, consumer discretionary and tech sectors, there is a good bit of overlap between technology and technology-enabled companies in the new communications services sector.Take Netflix NFLX for example. It’s a streaming company and doesn’t make computers like, say, Apple Inc. AAPL, but it’s still lumped together in the technology growth play that is the FAANG trade. But it’s also in the communications services sector. So on Tuesday, it wasn’t too surprising to see the whole FAANG group rally, led by NFLX’s more-than 6.5% jump on news that it would raise prices for its streaming subscriptions. The news that NFLX is confident enough to raise prices seems not only good for the tech sector but also as a barometer for consumer confidence as well. However, another school of thought might say that paying an extra $2 per month might not be that big a deal regardless of whether the economy is doing well or poorly. Plus, staying in and binge watching TV sounds more like something one might do during an economic downturn and would be a cheaper date than, say, going out to eat.The difference in performance from the financial sector, which was up just 0.81% Tuesday, and communications services, which tied for the best performing sector with a gain of 1.74%, can serve as a reminder that with the heightened news flow during earnings season investors’ attention can often be divided.The corporate communication also can help make trading more balanced, as company performance can help mitigate negative news flow. Or good news from overseas can help mute worries over domestic companies.We’ll have to watch and see which of the continuing themes of 2019 get the most focus in coming days: corporate earnings, Fed policy, the Chinese economy, trade, or Brexit.Figure 1: Dropping Dollar:The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY), which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies and is pictured here as a candlestick chart, has been on the decline after gaining sharply at the end of 2018. The ramifications of a meaningfully weaker dollar over time include the potential strengthening of overseas markets. Data Source: ICE. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  Inflection Point for the Dollar?: It’s arguable that the U.S. dollar is at a pivot point. The greenback rose against a basket of other currencies (see above) last year, helped in part by tax cut-spurred economic and corporate growth in the United States, safe-haven buying amid a topsy turvy stock market, and concerns about global growth as the trade war escalated. The Fed’s four interest rate hikes also helped boost the buck. But much of that scenario seems to be changing. The Fed has telegraphed a more measured approach, and U.S. stocks have been rebounding. Meanwhile, there are signs that the U.S. economy may not grow as fast this year and projections that corporate profits may not be as robust as the first-wave effects of tax reform wear off. So if the dollar is at a pivot point and does head meaningfully lower in 2019, what could that mean? For one thing, it may help alleviate some pressure on China and emerging markets. For China, a weaker dollar could help make Chinese investments more attractive, helping policy makers who are already looking toward fiscal stimulus as a means of shoring up their economy without devaluing the yuan. A weaker dollar would also bode well for emerging market countries with a lot of dollar-denominated debt. A falling U.S. dollar could mean that investors and traders might be considering moving some money into developed markets, such as the eurozone, especially if we get more clarity on Britain’s exit from the European Union. That could potentially help to boost their currencies at the expense of the dollar and might contribute to a 2019 where overseas markets could potentially outperform that of the United States. Producer Inflation Muted, Too: While inflation has an important impact on both producers and consumers, one advantage producers have is that they can often pass along higher production costs to end buyers. So keeping an eye on what producers pay for inputs can be an important part of Fed watching. At the moment, the Fed has been more dovish in its commentary, saying that it can afford to be patient with monetary policy because inflation is muted. As we saw last week, consumer prices in December fell 0.1% month over month and the core consumer price index, which strips out food and energy, rose an as-expected 0.2%. Those benign numbers were reinforced on Tuesday when data showed that December headline U.S. producer prices dropped by a more-than-expected 0.2% while core producer prices fell 0.1% even though a 0.2% rise had been expected. “Producer price inflation is moderating, which will suggest in the market’s mind that consumer price inflation is going to as well,” Briefing.com said.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

11,13,AAPL,"Tech Sector Earnings: Revenue Growth Widely Expected To Slow, Will Global Uncertainty Weigh?",https://www.benzinga.com/node/12995123,"Normally the information technology sector is seen as a higher-growth one, but that doesn’t look to be the case this quarter around as Q4 earnings season gets underway. As of Jan. 9 the blended revenue growth rate, a measure that includes analyst estimates and reported results, is just 1.7% year over year, according to Reuters data. That’s lagging every other sector except for utilities. Top-line results are expected to grow at a faster pace, with a blended earnings growth rate of 8.5% year over year, 7th out of 11 sectors. Granted, some of that has been attributed to certain tech companies being shifted to the newly formed communications services sector.Matching the high-level data, a few of the biggest names in the space have warned of a sales slowdown. Apple Inc. AAPL is often looked to as a barometer for the tech sector due to its size and global reach and it flashed warning signs recently that its fiscal Q1, which ended December 29, wasn’t going to be what the company or analysts had hoped. In an investor letter, CEO Tim Cook lowered AAPL’s revenue guidance for the quarter to $84 billion, 4.8% lower than last year’s results for the same quarter. Analysts had been expecting closer to $91 billion for the quarter and AAPL previously forecasted revenue in the range of $89 billion to $93 billion. AAPL’s reasons for the lowered guidance read like a laundry list of the growing concerns that analysts have had about the broader tech sector. Cook cited challenges in emerging markets and said “we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China,” while noting that more than 100% of the company’s year-over-year revenue decline occurred in that region. In addition, Cook pointed to increased consumer uncertainty in China amid heightened trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Guidance updates like this can often weigh on sector sentiment until results from more companies are released or other data emerges.Bouncing Back into Q4. The S&P Technology Select Sector Index (IXT) has been bouncing back after a rapid decline through the last few months of 2018. The macro environment has been filled with uncertainty and Q4 earnings might provide some hard data that could play a part in whether or not the sector can make a sustained breakout out of its recent downtrend. Chart source: thinkorswim® by TD Ameritrade. Not a recommendation. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Tech-Filled Holiday ShoppingAhead of the holidays, the Consumer Technology Association was forecasting that U.S. consumers would spend a record $96.1 billion on tech in the 2018 holiday season (October-December), good for a 3.4% year-over-year increase. U.S. retail sales figures for December were supposed to be released by the Census Bureau today, but they have been delayed due to the shutdown, so the latest retail data is limited to November. Those results showed that U.S. retail sales had increased 4.2% compared to November 2017. Over the holidays, there were some positive reports regarding consumer spending. Adobe Analytics reported that Cyber Monday was the biggest U.S. online shopping day ever, with consumers spending $7.9 billion overall. According to Adobe’s report, Take-Two Interactive’s TTWO Red Dead Redemption 2 video game, Nintendo’s NTDOY Switch console, and Dell and Apple Inc. AAPL laptops were some of the top-selling items. For consumer-focused tech companies that generate a large portion of their sales during the holiday season, this quarter’s results are likely to be particularly important as they enter the slower time of the year. Digital Payments and TechPayPal PYPL is a stock you might expect to find in the S&P Technology Select Sector Index (IXT). Mastercard Inc. MA and Visa V, on the other hand, you might not. Regardless, stocks in the digital payments space had a banner year relative to the broader market. PYPL ended 2018 with a 13.88% return, while V and MA put up 15.22% and 24.19% increases. One of the biggest performers in digital payments was Square Inc. SQ with a 55% return, despite pulling back $45 from its October high of $101.15. As cash usage decreases in many markets globally and some retailers go cashless, the digital payments space has been eyed by many analysts as one that could continue to grow for some time. Non-cash transactions are expected to grow at a 12.7% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2016 to 2021, with emerging markets growing at a 21.6% rate, according to a 2018 report from Capgemini and BNP Paribas. Even though analysts appear to be widely optimistic about the space, an overriding concern is valuation and that some companies will likely need to execute flawlessly to deliver on investor expectations. For example, forward P/E ratios for the companies mentioned above can vary from 26 to 90 today. At the same time, any attractive market brings competition. Not only are companies like Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Facebook, Inc. FB, Alibaba Group BABA and Alphabet GOOG pursuing opportunities in the space, regional players like StoneCo Ltd STNE and PagSeguro Digital Ltd PAGS abound as well. Major Earnings DatesThe companies below cover most of the major constituents of the communications services sector and when they’re scheduled to report earnings:

12,14,AAPL,Upcoming Earnings: Video Streaming Giant Netflix To Report After The Bell Thursday,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13001179,"Streaming service Netflix, Inc. NFLX is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell Thursday, Jan. 17. Earlier in the week, NFLX announced that it would be raising prices for U.S. subscribers by $1 to $2 depending on the plan. Investors sent shares up 6.5% on Tuesday following the announcement, as the move is projected to tack on a little over $1 billion in revenue per year based on current subscriber levels. Next quarter’s results should reveal the business impact of the price. For the quarter at hand, NFLX is expected to report EPS of $0.24, down from $0.41 in the prior-year period, on revenue of $4.21 billion, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected to grow 28% year over year (YoY). As has been the case in recent reports, subscriber additions, content spending and cash flow, and growing competition are likely to be some of the main areas analysts and investors hone in on. Subscriber AdditionsThis is typically NFLX’s largest quarter for subscriber additions and it has forecasted that it will add 9.4 million subscribers in the fourth quarter—1.8 million in the U.S. and 7.6 million internationally. That would bring its total subscriber count in the U.S. to 60.26 million and 86.24 million abroad. One thing to note is that NFLX’s subscriber addition guidance will only include paid memberships starting with this quarter’s report, whereas it previously included people that were on a free trial. When the company last reported, the stock climbed as much as 15% after subscriber growth beat analyst estimates by a wide margin in both the U.S. and international segments. Some analysts had been concerned that it couldn’t maintain the growth it had in the past as it scales and that the U.S. market was reaching saturation. That report seemed to put those concerns to rest for the time being. It’s too soon to see if subscriber additions will be impacted by the recent price hikes in the U.S. When the company hiked prices on its premium services in 2017, it indicated it hadn’t seen any major attrition following the move. Content Spending, Cash Flow and Other CostsOn a profit-and-loss basis, NFLX had forecasted that it would spend between $7.5 billion to $8 billion on content in 2018. Management has said that will increase in 2019, yet hasn’t provided a specific outlook.  Content isn’t the only area NFLX has been spending more and at the start of 2018 forecasted marketing spend would rise 56% to $2 billion and technology and development spending would increase 23% to $1.3 billion. The company’s hefty spending has resulted in a continual cash burn. In October, management said that its free cash flow for 2018 would come in around negative $3 billion and that 2019 would have similar levels. NFLX reported it had raised $2 billion through a debt offering in October, tacking on to its existing $12 billion in debt. Growing CompetitionIt’s no secret that there is growing competition in video streaming. Walt Disney Co DIS is rolling out new services and is set to gain majority control of Hulu once its acquisition of assets from 21st Century Fox FOXA closes, AT&T Inc. T has said it is planning a streaming service with its newly acquired Time Warner assets and Comcast Corporation CMCSA just announced its NBCUniversal division will launch one too. Tack on existing competition like Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and players like Apple Inc AAPL reportedly working on their own services, and the market is a far cry from what it was just a few years ago. NFLX CEO Reed Hastings has regularly acknowledged direct competition, as well as video games, social media, magazines, and all the other forms of entertainment the company is up against. In last quarter’s investor letter, he said “our job is to make Netflix stand out so that when consumers have free time, they choose to spend it with our service.” One part of the company’s strategy to do that has been to increasingly produce original content that viewers can’t get anywhere else. Wild Ride. In December, NFLX got all the way back down to $230, close to where it started the year, after peaking at an all-time high of $423.21 in June. The stock snapped back once it got down to that major area of support and has rallied all the way back to above $350. The past few days, the stock has struggled to get over the $360 mark, a level of resistance. Chart source: thinkorswim® by TD Ameritrade. Not a recommendation. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Netflix Options ActivityOptions traders have priced in a 7.2% ($25.30) stock move in either direction around NFLX’s earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim® platform. Implied volatility was at the 61st percentile as of this morning. In short-term trading at the Jan. 18 monthly expiration, calls have been active at the 350 and 360 strike prices. On the call side there has also been higher volume at the 380 and 400 strikes, a ways out of the money. For puts, recent volume has been concentrated at the 345 and 350 strikes. The 355-strike put has also been active and the stock was briefly trading above that level on Tuesday. There hasn’t been much activity in the next several weekly expirations that stands out. At the Feb. 15 monthly expiration, calls have been active at the 350 strike while puts have been active at the 330 and 340 strikes.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

13,16,AAPL,Consumer Discretionary Q4 Earnings: U.S. Consumer Appears Strong Amid Heightened Global Uncertainty,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13008290,"Ahead of upcoming earnings, the consumer discretionary sector has seen some volatility as many retailers issued new guidance once the holiday shopping season came to an end. Overall it’s been a mixed bag, with much of the weakness appearing to be concentrated in clothing and department stores. Macy’s Inc M, Nordstrom, Inc. JWN, Men’s Wearhouse and Jos A. Bank parent Tailored Brands Inc TLRD, and Ann Taylor parent Ascena Retail Group Inc ASNA were just a few of the names that lowered guidance after their holiday quarter apparently came up short of what they were expecting. For some time, different pockets of the consumer discretionary sector have faced challenges amid a competitive environment. For example, sporting goods retailers had a string of bankruptcies over the past few years, resulting in a more consolidated industry with a few major companies like Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc DKS. Toy stores have faced similar challenges: Toys “R” Us filed for bankruptcy, although a group of their lenders have decided to try to revive the brand.   Despite the challenges that have faced some consumer discretionary companies, there are still many that have thrived over the past several years. And there are a number of macro reasons that have likely provided a positive backdrop for the sector.Overall, the health of the U.S. consumer has been strong. The labor market remained strong in recent readings, with the unemployment rate coming in at 3.9% in December, up slightly from November’s 49-year low of 3.7%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even though unemployment ticked up in December, analysts weren’t too worried because the report showed that roughly 400,000 additional people started to look for work again.  At the same time, average hourly earnings in December increased 3.2% over the previous year, above the 3.1% growth seen in October and November. Inflation has also been muted in recent readings, indicating consumers aren’t seeing too much of their wage gains being eroded.Outside of the positives, there have been some concerns among analysts regarding the impact of rising rates denting consumer spending and borrowing. And consumer confidence remained high in December, although it slipped compared to previous months. From an earnings perspective, the consumer discretionary sector is expected to deliver earnings growth of 11.6% year over year (YoY) and revenue growth of 4.6% YoY in the fourth quarter, according to FactSet. Looking at 2019, FactSet’s earnings growth estimate is pegged at 9.4% YoY and revenue growth is expected to come in at 5.5% over last year—better than the S&P 500’s (SPX) expected 6.9% earnings growth and in line with its forecasted 5.5% revenue growth.Bouncing Back. The S&P Consumer Discretionary Select Sector Index (IXY) over the past year is charted above. After the broad selloff in December, the sector has been bouncing back and has returned to positive territory, outperforming both the Nasdaq Composite (COMP, teal line) and the S&P 500 (SPX, purple line).  Chart source: thinkorswim® by TD Ameritrade. Not a recommendation. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Tariffs and Geopolitical UncertaintyThe back and forth between the U.S. and China regarding tariffs has added to an already uncertain global environment. The effect of tariffs, combined with softening economic data in China and other regions, has varied from one company to another. Apple Inc. AAPL recently lowered its guidance, with CEO Tim Cook saying “we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China.” In addition, Cook pointed to increased consumer uncertainty in China resulting from heightened trade tensions as a cause.Out of the few companies that have reported results so far, some have acknowledged challenges in the region while others were more optimistic. AutoZone, Inc. AZO indicated it will continue to work with industry associations to express their concerns about the negative impact of increased tariffs. When Nike Inc. NKE reported in late December, management said they hadn’t seen any impact on their business there, which posted its 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth.Data DelayInvestors looking for data have been left a little empty handed lately due to the government shutdown, which has delayed reports that the Census Bureau puts out, such as U.S. retail sales. Their latest report covered November and showed U.S. retail sales were $513.5 billion, up 0.2% over October and 4.2% YoY. Excluding auto-related and gas station sales, retail sales were up 4.6% YoY.  Those results painted a mixed picture. Department store sales were down 0.2% compared to the previous year, whereas online retailers were up 10.8%. Electronics and appliance stores saw a 4% increase, while sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores were down 8.8%. The divergence among different classes of retail has been going on for some time.  Labor Inflation and Other CostsLabor inflation and transportation costs have been two areas that both company execs and analysts expressed concerns about over the course of 2018. Regarding the former, the labor market can be a double-edged sword for retailers. On one hand, wage growth and a tight labor market typically help support consumer spending. On the other, it can make it more challenging to attract and retain qualified workers, a common issue companies have expressed lately. Labor cost inflation was commonly cited on retail earnings calls as a source of margin pressure in 2018. Freight costs denting margins was another common refrain heard regularly on earnings calls in 2018. There are varied opinions among analysts about where transportation costs will go in 2019, but many retailers have indicated they still expect them to negatively impact bottom-lines in 2019.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

14,17,AAPL,"Geopolitics Aside, How About Those Earnings? Investors Appear To Switch Focus",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13024398,"Like a rubber band, it appears stocks are ready to snap back from Tuesday’s sharp losses as investors ponder a fresh set of earnings news. At the same time, nothing else seems to have really changed much. The same old stew of geopolitics continues to be the backdrop, with little progress to report on China talks, the government shutdown, or Brexit. Economic news continues to be grim out of Asia, with the latest batch coming from Japan (see more below).With those things looking pretty static—at least as of early Wednesday—investors could be looking for a diversion, and they may have gotten it in the form of earnings.Earnings Scorecard Gets an UpdateOne seemingly unlikely source of good cheer was IBM IBM. The company, whose shares are up 7.8% since the beginning of the January after a long slide marked by years of falling revenue, topped third-party revenue consensus estimates when it reported late Tuesday. Earnings per share also came in on top of analyst projections, and guidance looked stronger than many had expected. Shares jumped 6% in pre-market trading.IBM’s consulting business helped lead the way, and revenue from the company’s cloud-based offerings rose 12%. Last year, IBM bought software maker Red Hat to help it grow its presence in the cloud business. In its earnings press release, the company said “major clients worldwide” are turning to IBM cloud services, including French bank BNP Paribas. On the negative side, the company’s systems unit, which includes hardware and operating systems software, declined 21% in Q4.Two other key firms delivered mostly better than expected results early Wednesday: Procter & Gamble Co PG and United Technologies UTX. PG also raised guidance and saw shares move higher in pre-market trading. UTX gave what looked like a strong forecast for 2019 and saw shares up 4% before the opening bell.Abbott Laboratores ABT also reports this morning, and Ford Motor Company F is due after the closing bell. One question about F is whether its truck and SUV sales can continue to make up for any softness in demand for traditional cars. Another question is how the company might be affected by trade issues with China. The stock has been under a lot of pressure, and last week F reported preliminary 2018 earnings that failed to meet third-party consensus estimates.Volatility Roared Back TuesdayWall Street welcomed back an old friend on Tuesday: Volatility.The market’s most closely watched fear indicator, the VIX, spiked back above 20 after a couple weeks when it appeared to be on winter break. As VIX climbed and the major stock market indices retreated amid fears of world economic slowing and a possible hitch in China/U.S. trade talks, investors got a reminder that turbulent times could be far from  over. The VIX remained above 20 early Wednesday.Tuesday’s action could also serve as a reminder that most of the worries contributing to December’s sell-off haven’t really gone away. It’s true that the Fed is less of a primary concern and more secondary after signalling what appears to be a somewhat hands-off stance, at least for the moment.Other than that, however, there’s still the China situation, the global economy, Brexit, and the government shutdown. These are all things investors need to grapple with, making the next six months perhaps as important for the economy as we’ve seen in a long time.The so-called “three horses” of risk might be reflecting some of these concerns, as both U.S. Treasury notes and VIX galloped higher. Gold, the third risk marker, barely rose, however. The 10-year Treasury yield, which falls when bond prices rise, dipped back below 2.75% Tuesday after flirting with 2.8% last week. (See chart below). Gold fell overnight and crude came back a little, both possible signs of investor confidence.U.S./China Meeting Center StageStock markets around the world were already down on Tuesday even before news came at midday of a canceled meeting between U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators. The media said the disagreement was over intellectual property issues. However, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow came out right before the close to say the cancellation news was incorrect, and the market got a late lift from that. There’s only about five weeks left for the two countries to make a deal before U.S. tariffs are scheduled to rise. Intellectual property issues might be tying things up, according to a Bloomberg report over the weekend.The bearish China news hit the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) particularly hard, because some of its 30 names have businesses so closely tied to China. The stocks that come to mind are Boeing Co BA, Caterpillar Inc CAT, Apple Inc AAPL, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS and 3M Co MMM. At one point, these five stocks alone accounted for about 250 points of the $DJI’s 400-point losses. This kind of market action shows why many investors keep a closer eye on the broader S&P 500 Index (SPX), which has far more components and doesn’t get buffeted around so easily by weakness in a few names.Banks Step BackFinancials, which had been showing signs of life so far in 2019, took it on the chin Tuesday. That was especially true for Morgan Stanley MS, which fell nearly 3% and just hasn’t recovered its mojo since last week’s disappointing earnings report. Other big banks fell, too, which might have had to do in part with the pressure on Treasury yields. However, the 10-year yield rebounded early Wednesday and recently traded at 2.77%. We’ll see if that helps banks today.Also from a sector standpoint, some of the cyclicals that led last week brought up the rear Tuesday. Communication services, energy, consumer discretionary, industrials, and information technology all fell 2% or more. It’s just one day, but that looked like quite a contrast to the “risk-on” kind of trading seen much of last week. It’s getting toward the middle of earnings season, but so far, there hasn’t really been a lot of clarity on earnings calls about how executives see the tariff situation potentially affecting their businesses. It’s still up in the air, and companies might be struggling with what to do next. This could be making investors nervous, perhaps contributing to a more conservative type of trading. If executives seem conservative about their next steps, it might stand to reason that investors would feel the same way.On the data side, there wasn’t much help from the U.S. economy Tuesday as existing home sales for December decreased 6.4% month-over-month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.99 million. That was under the Briefing.com consensus of 5.25 million, and total sales were 10.3% lower than the same period a year ago. Sales declined in all regions despite mortgage rates coming down during the month. Also, weekly mortgage applications fell 2.7% last week. All this would seem to add another chapter in the ongoing story of a slowing U.S. housing market, and could play into those fears about the global economy easing.Speaking of economic easing, there was more negative economic news early Wednesday when Japan reported weak export data. The Bank of Japan reduced its inflation target and left its monetary easing program unchanged.If you’re trying to take any positives out of Tuesday’s retreat, the markets did rally back a bit from their lows in the final minutes of the session. Also, some analysts said stocks might have gotten over-bought last week, making them ripe for a sell-off. In addition, the SPX managed to close above its 50-day moving average of 2625, a level that could represent technical support. All that and earnings aside, the China situation is probably going to be front and center going into today, and any sign that more serious background issues potentially threaten negotiations might mean a chance for continued selling.FIGURE 1: FLASHES OF RISK-OFF? Though the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX - candlestick) fell in recent weeks and the 10-yr Treasury (TNX - purple line) rose over the same period—two indicators of a ""risk-on"" trading environment, both VIX and TNX reversed course in Tuesday's session. Data source: Cboe Global Markets. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  Europe’s Central Bank In Spotlight: This week’s meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) begins today, with a press conference scheduled for Thursday and analysts not expecting any major policy changes. Economists and investors have pushed back their expectations for higher European interest rates after a string of disappointing data, Bloomberg reported late last week. Trade tensions and a disorderly Brexit are seen as potential threats. ECB President Mario Draghi told the European Parliament last Tuesday that the region isn’t headed for a recession, though the current slowdown could last longer than expected. Remember that just last month, the ECB ended its qualitative easing (QE) program. The question now becomes, how slow would the region’s economy have to get to force the ECB to consider new forms of stimulus? That question could be one that Draghi faces at the press conference. Case of the Missing Data: Durable goods and new home sales for December are both supposed to come out this Friday, but don’t hold your breath waiting for the numbers. The government shutdown means they might not come out. Additionally, investors anticipating the scheduled Jan. 30 release of preliminary release of Q4 gross domestic product (GDP) might also find themselves disappointed. Many of the inputs for GDP have been delayed by the shutdown.This may seem like a mere inconvenience, but it’s also a bit troubling. Many companies rely on government economic data as they make their decisions about what to invest, and at this point, they could be flying partially blind. This goes beyond data. Johnson & Johnson’s JNJ CFO told CNBC Tuesday in an interview that the company is concerned about possible regulatory delays slowing approval of its pharmaceutical products. User fees that drug companies pay the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to help shorten approval time for certain products are running low, and the FDA can’t accept new fees during the shutdown, according to FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D.No Silver Bullet for Volatility: Back over the weekend, there were some analysts and investors quoted in the media saying the VIX might go back down to 14 or 15. Even at the time, before Tuesday’s sharp spike in volatility, that sounded like a head-scratcher. After all, the market is still wrestling with uncertainty over China, tariffs haven’t gone away, and economic news lately hasn’t been too enticing. Now few probably expected a double-digit jump in the VIX to start the week, but it shouldn’t be too surprising considering all the geopolitical forces at play. There’s also the potential of earnings news stirring up the markets. Several major companies, including Apple AAPL, are scheduled to report next week. The VIX is implying strong chances of more volatility as those results come in, so keep the seat belts fastened.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

15,18,AAPL,Kerrisdale: Qualcomm Ruling Could Cut 'Stock Price In Half',https://www.benzinga.com/node/13026042,"QUALCOMM, Inc. QCOM stock has more legal risk than the market is pricing in. In a new report out Wednesday, Kerrisdale Capital said Qualcomm is likely on the brink of losing its legal battle with the FTC, a decision which could have a major impact on Qualcomm’s bottom line.High Government Win RateKerrisdale said Judge Lucy Koh has already ruled against Qualcomm’s appeal to dismiss the case and ruled that the company is obligated to license its “standard essential” key patents to competitors such as Intel Corp. INTC on FRAND terms. Koh has also overruled Qualcomm’s objections to an ongoing class action lawsuit against the company alleging anticompetitive practices.“None of this guarantees that Qualcomm will lose to the FTC, but we and other trial watchers have been impressed by the FTC’s performance and, by contrast, surprised at the sometimes combative interactions between Judge Koh and Qualcomm’s legal team,” Kerrisdale wrote. “In general, government plaintiffs like the FTC enjoy a high win rate, and in this specific case the probability of government victory appears even higher than usual.”Kerrisdale is led by activist investor Sahm Adrangi, who Reuters noted ""cemented his reputation with successful bets against Chinese internet companies.""Potential ImpactKerrisdale said the stakes are far more threatening to Qualcomm’s long-term business outlook than a potential fine.“If the judge grants the FTC the remedies it seeks, forcing Qualcomm, among other things, to license core patents to competitors and to renegotiate all of its existing licenses on fair terms, it could realistically cut Qualcomm’s licensing revenue, earnings power, and stock price in half,” Kerrisdale said.The ruling would potentially remove Qualcomm’s rights to demand additional licensing fees from Apple, Inc. AAPL, Samsung Electronics or other device makers that buy chips from Intel that utilize Qualcomm’s patents.“Thus Qualcomm will be compelled to drastically reduce what Apple has called its ‘extortion-level royalties’ – plausibly by an order of magnitude,” Kerrisdale said.Major HeadwindsThe ruling in FTC v. Qualcomm could come as soon as February, and a loss could result in renegotiation of Qualcomm licensing terms that could ultimately reduce the company’s annual revenue by $2.7 billion, Kerrisdale said.An adjusted EPS in that scenario of $1.64 would imply a price target of around $21, the firm estimated. In addition, even in the seemingly unlikely event of a best-case scenario outcome from the FTC case, Kerrisdale said Qualcomm’s broader business will continue to face headwinds from an increasingly saturated global smartphone market.Qualcomm stock traded lower by 4.6 percent to $51.77 following the bearish commentary. At time of publication, Qualcomm had not responded to a request for comment.Related Links:Morgan Stanley Breaks Down Qualcomm's Best Legal Strategy With Apple Kerrisdale Has A New Favorite Long: SeaPhoto credit: Kārlis Dambrāns, Flickr",2019-01-23
16,20,AAPL,Market Looks To End Week On High Note Amid Potential Progress On Ending Shutdown,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13040197,"U.S. market participants awoke to a trio of positive news tidbits touching on the partial government shutdown, trade war, and Fed policy even as sentiment from a largely positive earnings season continued to provide momentum.On the political front, senators from both sides of the aisle said they would introduce an amendment that would temporarily reopen part of the government. While it’s too soon to tell exactly when the shutdown might end, it seems like lawmakers may be on the path to resolving the issue. Positive developments there are likely to encourage Wall Street, as companies have increasingly been voicing worries about the shutdown costing them money, or having the potential to.Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Reuters that the United States and China were “making a lot of progress” on talks to end the ongoing trade war that has sparked worries about global economic growth and weighed heavily on companies’ outlooks. His comments served as a counterpoint to less optimistic talk from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross (see more below).To round out the threesome of news apparently making the bulls happy, The Wall Street Journal reported that Fed officials are closer to ending the central bank’s bond portfolio wind-down. It said officials are near a decision to maintain a bigger portfolio than they had thought when they started shrinking those holdings two years ago.Also, in The Wall Street Journal, Facebook FB Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended the social media giant in an opinion piece, saying the company doesn’t sell users’ data. The op-ed seemed to help boost FB’s shares, giving more lift to a tech sector that has been a highlight to this earnings season, with a notable exception being Intel Corporation INTC. One geopolitical situation to consider monitoring is the fallout from presidential election turmoil in Venezuela and what that might mean for oil prices. Yesterday, West Texas Intermediate futures gained ground amid talk of sanctions against the South American OPEC member. It remains to be seen how much the situation might affect oil prices going forward, but it’s probably worth watching as oil prices help form key costs for transportation companies like airlines.Earnings Season Rolls OnWestern Digital Corp.'s WDC shares were higher, even though it reported adjusted earnings that missed expectations, as the company told investors its revenue would improve later this year. Meanwhile, Starbucks Corporation SBUX shares had a nice buzz going this morning after the company beat expectations on its top and bottom lines and said its same-store sales grew 4% in the U.S. market. Major companies reporting before the opening bell included consumer products company Colgate-Palmolive Company CL, homebuilder D.R. Horton Inc DHI and biopharmaceutical company AbbVie Inc ABBV.CL shares were down nearly 4% in early trade after it reported Q4 earnings that missed the Street view, although revenue was a bit more than expected. DHI shares were also in the red, down about 1%, on its Q1 earnings disappointment and despite revenue gains amid rising home prices. Earnings were $0.76 per share, up 52% from a year prior as homebuilding revenue increased 6% to $3.4 billion. The U.S. Census Bureau was scheduled to release its monthly new home sales report today, but that’s likely to be put off as it was last month due to the partial government shutdown.Administration Trade Comments WeighThe market on Thursday continued to be caught between optimism on the back of great earnings and fear resulting from geopolitics. Stocks ended mixed, with the S&P 500 (SPX) eking out gains, the Nasdaq (COMP) performing a bit better, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) ending slightly in the red.First, let’s consider what drove bearish sentiment. Mostly, it seemed to stem from comments by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who told CNBC that the United States and China are “miles and miles” from reaching a trade deal and have “lots and lots of issues.”It seems that Ross’s comments may have put a cap on gains in a market that has been seeing positive momentum from a generally solid earnings season. The tariff issue is arguably more of a threat to company earnings growth than recent fears about the Federal Reserve possibly making a mistake and tightening monetary policy too aggressively even as inflation is muted. Based on recent commentary from the Fed, it seems that the latter worries have eased up somewhat.Tech Shares ShineDuring a day when tech was the best performing of the 11 SPX sectors, it was interesting to note that Apple Inc AAPL shares finished the day slightly softer. True, much of the gains were focused in the chip space, and that’s a different business than what AAPL does. But the pressure on the company’s shares Thursday seems to be a reminder of just how much exposure AAPL has to what happens in China, which makes up a good chunk of its sales and supply chain. Talking about technology shares leads us to the other side of yesterday’s coin: optimism about corporate results. The tech-heavy COMP edged out the other two main indices after Xilinx, Inc. XLNX, Lam Research Corporation LRCX, and Texas Instruments Incorporated TXN reported better-than-expected earnings. The PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX) rose more than 5.7%. (See more below.)The chipmaker party also appeared to be fueled by good expectations for Intel’s INTC quarterly report after the bell. But those hopes short circuited after the big semiconductor maker reported quarterly revenue and a Q1 earnings outlook that were short of analyst expectations. In separate corporate news, Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. PCG shares jumped more than 74% after California investigators cleared the utility of responsibility in a deadly 2017 fire. But the company, which recently said it intended to file for bankruptcy, said it “still faces extensive litigation, significant potential liabilities and a deteriorating financial situation.” The company’s shares remain down significantly from their 2017 peak above $70, even when including Thursday’s rally that took the shares to a close just shy of $14.Figure 1: Chip on Your Shoulder? The PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX) rallied on Thursday amid optimism in the space after strong earnings reports, but ahead of results from Intel, which ended up disappointing on revenue. Overall, the index has been under pressure in recent months on worries about the U.S.-China trade war and concerns about iPhone sales. Data Source: Nasdaq. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  Looking at Labor: With much focus on the hundreds of thousands of workers out of jobs during the partial government shutdown, it may be worth remembering that overall the nation’s job market remains tight. Data from the Labor Department (which was funded before the shutdown and remains open) on Thursday showed that weekly initial claims for unemployment dropped by 13,000 to 199,000, less than a Briefing.com consensus expectation of 217,000. The new figure is the lowest level for initial claims since mid-November 1969. Perhaps a more helpful data set is the four-week moving average for initial claims. That figure also dropped, by 5,500 to 215,000. While a tight labor market can lead to wage inflation, it is also a signal of a strong economy. US GDP Growth Could Slow: But the job market isn’t the only economic indicator out there. Fresh data from the Conference Board Thursday added to the drumbeat of worries about the potential for slowing growth in the United States. Its index of leading economic indicators dropped by 0.1% in December, in line with a Briefing.com consensus forecast. The decline suggests that growth in the U.S. economy could slow this year, the Conference Board said. “While the effects of the government shutdown are not yet reflected here, the (index) suggests that the economy could decelerate towards 2% growth by the end of 2019,” according to Ataman Ozyildirim, director of economic research at the Conference Board.Technically Speaking: While geopolitical factors seem to be providing the macroeconomic reasons for tepid gains in stocks on Wednesday and Thursday, technical factors could also be at play. According to i10 Research, the SPX has been in a zone of resistance between 2629 and 2674. The market has been testing the lower end of that range, as the SPX has dipped below 2629 in each of the last three sessions but then managed to close above that level. Still, the bias remains bearish as long as the index is below 2674, according to i10.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

17,21,AAPL,"Stock Market Gets Lift On Deal To Reopen Govt.; Positive Trade, Fed News Also Help",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13043261,"Stocks finished the week on a high note as cautious optimism from earlier in the week ended with solid gains. Buying momentum continued amid news of a deal to temporarily reopen the U.S. government, positive commentary from the administration on the U.S.-China trade front, and a report that the Fed may keep more bonds in its portfolio than previously thought.The administration and Congress struck a deal to end the partial government shutdown for three weeks. While the funding is only temporary and the jury is still out on a final deal, lawmakers have taken a concrete step on the path to resolving the issue. The announcement confirmed hopes that had helped the market rise in morning trading and comes as companies have increasingly been voicing worries about the shutdown costing them money, or having the potential to.The market also gained support after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Reuters that the United States and China were “making a lot of progress” on talks to end the ongoing trade war that has sparked worries about global economic growth and weighed heavily on companies’ outlooks. His comments served as a counterpoint to less optimistic talk from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.This was the fifth-straight week of gains for the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI), marking a solid start to the new year.Fed’s Bond Portfolio in FocusMeanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported that Fed officials are closer to ending the central bank’s bond portfolio wind-down. It said officials are near a decision to maintain a bigger portfolio than they had thought when they started shrinking those holdings two years ago.While the Fed’s interest rate hike trajectory has been closely scrutinized, the unwinding of its balance sheet has also been a form of hawkish monetary policy. So the market appears to be interpreting the news of the Fed potentially keeping a larger balance sheet as bullish. When the Fed lets more bonds onto the market, that tends to weigh on bond prices, which then causes yields to rise and increases borrowing costs. The central bank bought the bonds as part of its quantitative easing program, designed to stimulate the economy by pushing up bond prices and lowering yields, which kept borrowing costs lower.Tech Rally ContinuesTech stocks performed well again on Friday, with the tech heavy Nasdaq (COMP) outperforming the two other main U.S. indices. This capped a week of generally solid performance among tech companies after mostly strong economic reports set up the sector nicely ahead of expected earnings reports next week from Apple Inc. AAPL and Microsoft Corporation MSFT. Facebook FB, now in the communication services sector but still a tech heavyweight, also reports next week.FB shares rose after Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended the social media giant in an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, saying the company doesn’t sell users’ data. On Friday, Western Digital Corp's WDC shares gained ground even though it reported adjusted earnings that missed expectations, as the company told investors its revenue would improve later this year.Earlier in the week, Xilinx, Inc. XLNX, Lam Research Corporation LRCX, and Texas Instruments Incorporated TXN reported better-than-expected earnings, helping to boost the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX)A notable exception to the solid performance from the tech sector this week was Intel Corporation INTC which reported quarterly revenue and a Q1 earnings outlook that were short of analyst expectations.Fed Meeting on DeckThe Fed is scheduled to conclude its two-day January meeting on Wednesday. Based on futures market activity, it looks like investors and traders are expecting the central bank to stand pat on interest rates. That would jibe with recent commentary from Fed officials that policy makers can be patient with any potential rate hikes because inflation is tame. Still, it could be interesting to try to read the tea leaves in the language accompanying the Fed’s interest rate decision. Investors may be looking for clues as to the Fed’s thinking on the impact of the ongoing trade war with China as well as what monetary policy officials make of any lingering effects of the partial government shutdown and the potential for economic damage if it resumes.One effect that the shutdown has had is to delay economic data. That means the Fed – like company executives, investors, analysts, and economists – has been flying partially blind when it comes to making data-dependent decisions.Economic Data and EarningsOne big report that investors likely won’t be seeing on time is the government’s first estimate of Q4 gross domestic product. The GDP reports are among the biggest economic data news events for investors and traders. But even with the temporary government reopening they will likely have to wait given the length of the shutdown, how long employees have been furloughed, and how long it takes to cobble together the GDP report from other data sets that are also incomplete because of the shutdown.While the GDP report leaves a big hole in the economic data calendar, investors are scheduled to still have plenty to chew on. Notable economic reports next week include indexes on consumer confidence and manufacturing as well as the monthly nonfarm payrolls report. That last one is likely to be especially closely watched as the labor market is a key barometer for economic health, and average hourly earnings form an important part of inflation expectations. As if investors didn’t already have enough on their plate, there is a slate of major companies reporting quarterly results in coming days. Those include Caterpillar Inc. CAT, which has been closely watched as a barometer for global growth potential amid the continued trade dispute between China and the United States. Boeing Co BA results are also on tap. The world’s largest aircraft manufacturer has warned that the government shutdown could end up hurting its business as well as that of the overall airline industry. So it could be interesting to see whether company executives discuss this further, especially in light of Friday’s news of a temporary reopening. Other major companies on tap next week include AT&T Inc. T, Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, Tesla Inc TSLA, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, McDonald’s Corp MCD, and Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT.Volatility eased as the week ended, with the VIX falling back below 18. It had been above 20 earlier in the week amid concerns about global economic data and a possible U.S.-China impasse on trade. Still, with all these earnings and a Fed meeting coming up, it seems unlikely that VIX would come down much further anytime soon. The dollar also lost a bit of ground Friday, falling nearly 1% by the close to below 96. The dollar might have seen some pressure from that Wall Street Journal article about the Fed’s potential balance sheet plans. A weaker dollar, if it continues, could be another boost for U.S. stocks, as it can help make prices for U.S. goods more attractive abroad. The lower dollar also might be giving crude a slight boost, though concerns about Venezuela also could have been at play (see Fig. 1).Figure 1: U.S. crude futures jumped again amid ongoing political turmoil in Venezuela. The White House is reportedly considering sanctions against the South American OPEC nation after it recognized an opposition leader as the legitimate president and the incumbent broke ties with Washington. Data Source: CME Group Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Reading Between the Lines: With a bevy of large companies reporting quarterly results in coming days, including global economic bellwether Caterpillar Inc. CAT, now may be a good time for the market to glean some insight into two of the highest profile issues of the day: the economic effects of the U.S.-China trade war and the partial U.S. government shutdown. The trade dispute has been going on long enough that companies may talk about it in their earnings releases. But investors may also want to pay attention to executive commentary during conference calls as they might provide what analysts call “color” on how the issue is affecting their business or how they think it might affect it in the future. And those conference calls with analysts and investors may also provide more clarity on executives’ thinking on whether the government shutdown has impacted their businesses. Grounded: Flying is a great way to catch the flu. Being stuck inside an aluminum tube with dozens of other people for hours on end just increases the likelihood of germ transfer. On Friday, an increase in staff calling in sick led the Federal Aviation Administration to reroute air traffic and increase the time between flights, the FAA said in a statement. FAA employees have been working without pay during the partial government shutdown. Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL tweeted that the company during the morning was experiencing about 200 flight delays at LaGuardia Airport. For those waiting for a flight in New York and looking for a silver lining, perhaps public pressure after feeling the widening effects of the government shutdown could help spark a quicker final resolution to the funding impasse.GDP Forecast Lowered: With the partial U.S. government shutdown keeping the Bureau of Economic Analysis shuttered, it seems unlikely that investors will see one of the agency’s biggest reports in coming days. Originally scheduled for release on Wednesday, the bureau’s first estimate of Q4 GDP appears likely to be delayed as the agency hasn’t been funded during the shutdown. Investors and company leaders looking to fill the data vacuum may want to consider the latest 4Q GDP forecast from the Atlanta Fed. Its freshest GDPNow model estimate, released Friday, forecasts a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.7%, down from 2.8% on Jan. 18. The Atlanta Fed lowered the estimate after data from the National Association of Realtors showed a larger-than-expected decline in existing home sales.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

18,22,AAPL,"Deal To Reopen Govt. Boosts Wall Street As Trade, Fed News Also Help",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13047390,"It’s crunch time, and that doesn’t just mean the crunch of snow under boots as more snow and extreme cold blow into much of the country.This is arguably the most crucial earnings week of the season, with names ranging from Boeing Co BA to Apple Inc AAPL to Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN opening their books. About 25% of S&P 500 companies report over the next five days. In addition, Friday brings the closely watched January payrolls report. On top of all that, a Fed meeting starts tomorrow.Caterpillar Inc CAT kicked off the fun early Monday, missing analysts’ average earnings projections by quite a bit (see more below). That, along with new concerns about China’s economy and worries about another government shutdown, appeared to put pressure on stocks in pre-market trading. The shutdown may have ended last week, but things still aren’t settled.Overseas, the British pound was higher to start the week, helping drag down British stocks ahead of another week of Brexit meetings.Full Plate of Earnings On TapLooking at this week’s earnings schedule, both the industrial and tech sectors stand out. Results could help investors get a better sense of the economy’s path and consumer health in Q4. That’s only part of the story however. Investors might also want to listen and watch closely for company guidance, as well as any remarks from executives about how they see 2019 shaping up. This is always important, but probably has more impact this year considering all the geopolitical plates spinning. One question is how the government shutdown might have affected business for some firms.CAT got things started early Monday. Earnings per share of $2.55 were well below the third-party consensus estimate. Revenue of $14.34 billion was a little above average analyst estimates. The company forecast a “modest” sales increase in 2019, but its earnings guidance range looked on the light side. Shares of CAT fell 6% in pre-market trading, and the company cited increased materials and tariff costs. Sales fell in the Asia/Pacific region.This is a little concerning, though nothing to necessarily get too worried about. CAT is just one company, and we’ll have to see what other major industrial companies report. From a buildings and construction view, the weakness in Asia doesn’t look that great.BA has warned that the government shutdown could end up hurting its business, as well as that of the overall airline industry. So it could be interesting to see whether company executives discuss this further, especially in light of Friday’s news of a temporary reopening. Other major companies on tap next this week include AT&T Inc T, Verizon Communications Inc VZ, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Tesla Inc TSLA, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, McDonald’s Corp MCD, and Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT. Earnings from Apple are likely to get a very close look tomorrow afternoon after the company’s previous earnings and outlook disappointed many investors and helped send the widely-held stock into a tailspin. Another blow came earlier this month when AAPL dialed back its fiscal Q1 revenue expectations, a rare event. The company is no longer breaking out iPhone unit sales, so it might be more challenging to get a sense of exactly how that important product is performing.AAPL and AMZN, in particular, could help investors better understand how consumer demand looked during the holiday shopping season. Some major retailers reported disappointing holiday sales stats earlier this month, and consumer confidence sagged in the latest University of Michigan sentiment report.About 72% of the companies that had reported earnings as of Friday morning have beaten expectations, according to CNBC. In terms of revenue, however, there are just 58% that beat forecasts, down from about 70% in recent quarters. That means a fair number of companies are missing analysts’ revenue expectations, something perhaps to monitor as this week rolls along.Ticker Tape will be running previews of a number of earnings reports starting today, so stay tuned.Rates Not Seen Changing, But Fed Meeting Could Bring Key InsightsIt’s tempting to downplay the importance of this week’s Fed meeting, considering the heavy load of earnings and data on tap in coming days. Despite all that—and the market dialing in about a 99% chance of the Fed standing pat on rates—the meeting likely deserves close scrutiny. Two reasons come to mind. First, the Fed could shed more light on Friday’s Wall Street Journal report saying Fed officials are closer to ending the central bank’s bond portfolio wind-down. While the Fed’s interest rate trajectory has been closely scrutinized, the unwinding of its balance sheet has also been a form of hawkish monetary policy. Perhaps we might learn additional detail about what level of balance sheet holdings the Fed might want to maintain. This could play into the path of Treasury yields and provide clues about future borrowing costs.The other reason not to ignore the Fed meeting is the accompanying press conference from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. He’s going to speak after every Fed meeting this year, not just quarterly. Beyond all that, It could also be interesting to try to read the tea leaves in the language accompanying the Fed’s decision. Investors may be looking for clues about the Fed’s thinking on the impact of the trade war with China. There’s also the question of whether the Fed sees any potential economic ramifications from the recent government shutdown.Coming Off StrengthStocks finished the old week on a high note. Buying momentum continued amid news of a deal to temporarily reopen the U.S. government. The administration and Congress struck a deal to end the partial government shutdown for three weeks. As the deadline of Feb. 15 starts to draw closer, stocks might start getting a bit more volatile. However, it’s arguable that the shutdown didn’t really have a major impact on trading this time around. More shutdown fears surfaced early Monday after President Trump said over the weekend that there’s still a chance of another one.The market also gained support Friday after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Reuters that the United States and China were “making a lot of progress” on talks to end the ongoing trade war that has sparked worries about global economic growth and weighed heavily on companies’ outlooks. His comments served as a counterpoint to less optimistic talk earlier in the week from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. China was in the news again early Monday. It reported industrial profits for December falling by 1.9%, the second monthly decline in a row. For all of 2018, the figure rose 10.3%, about half the level seen in 2017.Last week was the fifth-straight week of gains for the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI), marking a solid start to the new year. However, the S&P 500 (SPX) failed to achieve a fifth-consecutive winning week, falling just a few points short.Volatility eased as the old week ended, with the VIX falling back below 18. It had been above 20 earlier in the week amid concerns about global economic data and a possible U.S.-China impasse on trade. Still, with all these earnings and the Fed meeting coming up, it seems unlikely that VIX would come down much further anytime soon. VIX was back above 18 early Monday.Figure 1: U.S. crude futures jumped again amid ongoing political turmoil in Venezuela.

Past performance does not guarantee future results.Reading Between the Lines: With a bevy of large companies reporting quarterly results in coming days, including global economic bellwether Caterpillar, now may be a good time for the market to glean some solid insight into two of the highest profile issues of the day: the economic effects of the U.S.-China trade war and the partial U.S. government shutdown. The trade dispute has been going on long enough that companies may talk about it in their earnings releases. But investors may also want to pay attention to executive commentary during conference calls as they might provide what analysts call “color” on how the issue is affecting their business or how they think it might affect it in the future. And those conference calls with analysts and investors may also provide more clarity on executives’ thinking on whether the government shutdown has impacted their businesses. Grounded: Flying is a great way to catch the flu. Being stuck inside an aluminum tube with dozens of other people for hours on end just increases the likelihood of germ transfer. On Friday, an increase in staff calling in sick led the Federal Aviation Administration to reroute air traffic and increase the time between flights, the FAA said in a statement. FAA employees have been working without pay during the partial government shutdown. Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL tweeted that the company during the morning was experiencing about 200 flight delays at Laguardia Airport. For those who waited for a flight in New York and want a silver lining, perhaps public pressure from the widening effects of the government shutdown helped spark a quicker resolution to the funding impasse.GDP Forecast Lowered: With the partial U.S. government shutdown keeping the Bureau of Economic Analysis shuttered, it seems unlikely that investors will see one of the agency’s biggest reports in coming days. Originally scheduled for release on Wednesday, the bureau’s first estimate of Q4 GDP appears likely to be delayed as the agency hasn’t been funded during the shutdown. Investors and company leaders looking to fill the data vacuum may want to consider the latest 4Q GDP forecast from the Atlanta Fed. Its freshest GDPNow model estimate, released Friday, forecasts a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.7%, down from 2.8% on Jan. 18. The Atlanta Fed lowered the estimate after data from the National Association of Realtors showed a larger-than-expected decline in existing home sales. Now that data is trickling back in with the government reopened, investors might want to keep an eye on the Atlanta Fed’s GDP forecast for an update.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

19,23,AAPL,"Podcast: Nike Continues To Expand With MLB Deal, Streaming War Heats Up",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13049416,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research, in which Associate Stock Strategist Ben Rains dives into Nike Inc's NKE new deal with Major League Baseball. The episode also breaks down some news from Alphabet Inc's GOOGGOOGL YouTube TV and Hulu as the streaming TV war heats up.Nike late last week announced a 10-year deal with MLB that will see the sportswear giant become the official uniform and footwear supplier of the league starting in 2020. The deal makes Nike the brand behind the NFL, NBA, and MLB, which are the three most popular professional sports leagues in North America.Rumors had floated for some time now that Nike would take over this 10-year deal from Under Armour Inc UAA, which originally inked almost the exact same deal with MLB in 2016. Under Armour backed out based on various changes to their business strategy as it struggles to adapt to the athleisure driven sportswear climate.Nike's new deal with MLB will also see e-commerce sports apparel power Fanatics supply the gear for fans, which is what the firm will soon do for the NFL as well. Fanatics is certainly a company to keep an eye on since its owner Michael Rubin has seemed to carve out a niche in an e-commerce market dominated by a few mega retailers. Meanwhile, investors should note that Morgan Stanley has grown more bullish on Nike and less positive on rival Adidas ADDYY.Moving on, Google's YouTube TV said last week that it is expanding nationwide. The $40-a-month service is one of a handful of streaming TV offerings that allows users to truly cut the cord and still watch live TV. One of YouTube TV's main selling points is the ability to watch live sports from ESPN, Fox, and more. Hulu also announced last week that it is set to lower the price of its basic plan and raise the price of Hulu + Live TV.These moves will become increasingly important as Walt Disney Co DIS, Apple Inc. AAPL and AT&T Inc. T prepare to launch their own streaming services. Investors should pay close attention to the streaming market because it is set to become as crowded as ever. And with more options, firms will have to do all they can to attract and retain users.Related Links:As Nike Rebounds, So Does Foot Locker, Says Bullish JefferiesMorgan Stanley: Adidas' Pain Is Nike's Gain",2019-01-28

21,28,AAPL,Apple Earnings: Consumer Health May Be On Display As Company Opens Its Books,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13056546,"If any one company has a major influence on investors’ view of the market, Apple Inc AAPL might be able to stake that claim. Its influence on stock indices, mutual funds and ETFs, as well as on investor holdings, mean that it has both a price and psychological influence on the market.When AAPL cut its quarterly revenue expectations earlier this month, it raised concerns not just about the health of the iPhone maker, but about consumer demand throughout the economy.One primary theme investors have heard over the last six months is that the global economy might be slowing, but the consumer appears to be healthy. Considering Apple’s consumer-driven product lineup, if the company experiences a slowdown, what does that truly mean for the consumer overall?Tuesday afternoon might bring some answers as AAPL get set to release its fiscal Q1 earnings after the closing bell in what could be one of the more difficult earnings reports for the tech giant. However, some of the bad news might already be penciled in after AAPL’s recent warning that it would miss its own revenue expectations by as much as 7%.AAPL earnings are part of a horde of major tech and internet companies reporting this week. Some of the others include Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Amazon.com, Inc., AMZN, and Facebook FB. Arguably none of these, however, have the outsize influence of AAPL, which surprised investors at its last earnings by announcing it would stop breaking out unit sales of the iPhone (see more below).China TroublesAAPL shares took a plunge early this month after it announced in a letter from CEO Tim Cook that it was likely to see lower-than-expected revenue of $84 billion because of sliding iPhone sales in China, which AAPL blamed on ongoing tariff tensions between the U.S. and China. The company had previously guided for fiscal Q1 revenue of $89 billion to $93 billion. As some analysts noted at the time, it’s very rare for AAPL to have to dial back its own expectations.Some Wall Street analysts have also said that AAPL’s sales struggles in China may be due in part to increased competition there as well as the increasing price of iPhones. Recent economic data from China also points to slowing economic growth there, which could have implications for sales of AAPL products.But AAPL stock has since rebounded this month, up 10% after recovering from a low of about $142 per share Jan. 3. It now trades near $156 per share.AAPL is now down about 8% over the past 52 weeks and is down about 30% in the past three months, roughly since its last quarterly report. Shares had peaked last fall at all-time highs above $230. See figure 1 below.Apple’s Revenue and Guidance on WatchThe consensus earnings estimate for AAPL is $4.17 per share, according to third-party estimates. Revenue is projected to fall slightly to $84 billion, down 4.8% from $88.3 billion in the same quarter last year.Last time out, AAPL reported Q4 earnings of $2.91 per share on revenue of $62.9 billion, both of which beat Street estimates. But shares plunged 7% to below its landmark $1 trillion-plus market cap after it reported iPhone sales of 46.9 million were essentially flat from the year prior. Compensating for the drag on sales, AAPL had increased the price of the iPhones so it reported an average selling price of $793 in Q4 2018, up 28% from the previous Q4.For this quarter, investors will likely be watching for any changes or additions to AAPL’s guidance, which could be more cautious, perhaps either because of possible ongoing struggles with iPhone sales or to prevent another disappointment. Guidance could also reflect AAPL’s expectations for how the U.S.-China tariff tensions could play out, or how the trade policies could affect its bottom line.One thing investors won’t be watching for is specific iPhone sales numbers, as AAPL said last quarter it will no longer release those figures. Essentially, the company said it didn’t want investors focusing on unit sales as a measure of the strength of its business. However, this quarter’s numbers will now include specific gross margin and revenue from its services service business that includes fees from Apple Music and its App Store, so investors may get a sense of how those lines are faring.There’s been more internal focus on the services business growth in recent quarters, but also concern that iPhone demand could be fading as customers keep their phones longer or balk at higher prices for new models.Figure 1: CLAWING BACK, BUT WELL OFF THE HIGHS. AAPL shares gained back most of the 10% they lost in early January, when the company lowered its revenue outlook. However, shares sit well off the all-time high of 233 from a couple months prior.

22,29,AAPL,"Apple Today, Powell Tomorrow: Busy Earnings And Fed Week Continues",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13057537,"It’s a fully packed day with earnings from Apple Inc. AAPL, the start of a Fed meeting, several other major companies reporting, and more concerns about U.S. relations with China. U.S. stocks had a mixed tone in pre-market trading following a similar pattern in Europe and Asia. A development just after the closing bell yesterday could be a factor, as U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges against Chinese smartphone maker Huawei Technologies. One thing markets tend to dislike is uncertainty, and this might create even more. Asian markets took some heat Tuesday, and the Chinese government told Reuters the charges were “unfair.”This new wrinkle comes just as China and the U.S. prepare for more trade talks in coming days. It could raise concerns about the ramifications for those negotiations with the deadline for an agreement just over a month away. The new worries also followed two major U.S. companies with China exposure—Caterpillar Inc. CAT and Nvidia Corporation NVDA—disappointing investors with their outlooks Monday. Stocks fell sharply on the news, though major indices did recover slightly from their lows before the closing bell. The two-pronged China news—tensions between the governments and U.S. companies reporting weakness in their businesses across the Pacific—might reinforce impressions that the focus remains squarely on U.S./China relations and China’s economy. Apple and AMD This AfternoonStepping away from China for just a bit, there’s a full schedule of earnings today, with AAPL after the close probably in line for much of the attention. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD also reports after the closing bell.Last time out, AAPL delivered what many analysts called disappointing guidance. Then earlier this month AAPL surprised the market by lowering its quarterly revenue outlook to $84 billion. It cited a number of issues, but emphasized what it called “economic deceleration” in Greater China. Investors should probably consider gearing up to hear any further detail when the company reports. Shares were up just a bit in pre-market trading. Also, AAPL has stopped reporting unit sales of its iPhone, which might mean a little less granularity than people were used to.In earnings news early Monday, Pfizer Inc. PFE and 3M Co MMM reported better than expected earnings and revenue, but PFE’s guidance for 2019 was weaker than expected and MMM lowered its 2019 earnings guidance. Verizon Communications Inc. VZ also reported, beating analysts’ average earnings estimate but coming in slightly short on revenue compared with third-party consensus expectations. Taking a closer look at MMM, earnings looked good, but the company forecast slower growth projections in Asia. That’s pretty much what a lot of companies are doing right now. The lower earnings guidance didn’t look too significant, and the stock, which had fallen in pre-market trading, started to plow higher in the hour before the opening bell and appeared to take the rest of the market with it.Another big report today came from Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT, which saw earnings miss third-party consensus expectations of $4.40 a share by one penny. Revenue easily beat expectations, but guidance was below the Street’s expectations and shares fell in pre-market trading. LMT competitor Boeing Co BA is due with its earnings tomorrow.Caterpillar, Nvidia Issue Disappointing OutlooksGoing back to yesterday, CAT fell well short of third-party consensus with its Q4 earnings per share. In addition, CAT’s forward guidance for 2019 came in short of the average Wall Street estimate.The company blamed some of its troubles on a slowing Chinese economy, which shouldn’t be too surprising for anyone who’s been watching the data recently. China’s growth last year was the softest since 1990. In addition, China on Monday reported industrial profits for December falling by 1.9%, the second monthly decline in a row. For all of 2018, the figure rose 10.3%, about half the level seen in 2017.Think about all those photos you see of construction cranes in places like Shanghai and Beijing. When that construction demand weakens, companies like CAT can suffer. China accounts for 10% to 15% of CAT’s construction unit revenue, the company has said.Then there’s NVDA, which saw shares fall more than 13% Monday as it warned of weaker than expected sales due to China’s economic struggles. Other chip companies took a fall along with NVDA in apparent sympathy, and info tech was the worst performing U.S. sector of the day, falling about 1.5%. Beyond the basic impact on NVDA, CAT, and the tech and industrial sectors, the weak guidance from these two companies might raise concerns about other major industrial and tech names due to report this week. Some of those include Microsoft Corporation MSFT, AAPL, Honeywell International Inc. HON, McDonald’s Corp MCD, and General Electric Company GE. AAPL and MSFT are two of the four largest U.S. companies in terms of market capitalization, so investors might be concerned about any weakness in their earnings potentially having a reverberating impact. Investors Steer Away From RiskAs we’ve often seen recently, bad news from China seemed to send some investors scurrying toward so-called “defensive” parts of the market. Treasury notes rose on Monday, with the 10-year yield dipping back below 2.75%. Consumer staples and utilities were two of the best performing stock sectors. Gold scooted back up above $1,300 an ounce and continued higher early Tuesday.Meanwhile, the market’s most closely watched “fear indicator,” the VIX, jumped sharply to above 19, after falling below 18 last week. See chart below. VIX eased back under 19 by Tuesday morning.As the Fed starts its meeting, one school of thought suggests that softness in China and other economies could keep the Fed from evolving away from the dovish stance many Fed officials have taken in recent weeks. Futures trading indicates virtually no chance of a rate change. Looking further out, chances for a hike even by June are around 18%, according to CME Group futures. Figure 1: Figure 1: VIX BRIEFLY BACK ABOVE 20. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) spent most of January drifting downward after a spike around the holidays. Since bottoming at 17 earlier this month, the fear gauge pierced the 20 level on two occasions, most recently Monday morning. Data source: Cboe Global Markets. Chart Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Could Fed Meeting Stir Up Volatility?: Some Fed meetings used to be run of the mill affairs, especially when there was no press conference scheduled and no expectations in the market for a rate change. While futures prices point to virtually no chance of a rate move tomorrow, that doesn’t mean the meeting this week is necessarily a non-event for the market. In fact, volatility might be something to consider watching as Fed Chair Jerome Powell takes the podium afterward. He’s going to be holding press conferences after this and every Fed meeting from now on. If you remember, Powell’s press conference after the December meeting arguably helped set off a major drop in stock prices. That doesn’t mean the same thing necessarily would happen again, but it does seem like Powell’s remarks often get a bearish view from investors. Anyone trading actively should probably consider treading carefully in the hour or two after this week’s Fed meeting ends Wednesday afternoon. One thing to watch is for any words from Powell that the market might interpret as slightly hawkish, because in the recent past, such utterances from the Fed chair have seemed to really weigh on stocks quite quickly. The Fed is still the Fed and its potential impact is something that can’t be ignored.Cold Weather’s Potential Bite: Much of the Midwest and upper Great Lakes are experiencing the most intense cold wave to hit the region in more than two decades. Temperatures are forecast to plunge well below negative 20 Fahrenheit today and tomorrow in cities like Minneapolis, Chicago, and Milwaukee. Temperatures could fall to zero or colder in Detroit and Cleveland, as well. When the mercury hits these kind of levels, the first temptation is often to simply stay inside. That’s a good way to stay warm, but it’s not necessarily good for the economy. In the last few years, cold and snowy winters across much of the U.S. have bitten into Q1 economic growth. It could be interesting to see if Q1 gross domestic product and company earnings suffer at all from the weather. We won’t get a sense of that until April when the first estimate for Q1 GDP comes out and companies start reporting Q1 earnings. By then, the robins will likely be chirping and flowers blooming, but Q1 numbers could potentially remind investors of a bitter winter.Crude Hits Wall: The crude market looks like it’s come up against a barrier once again at around $53 a barrel for U.S. WTI futures. It’s climbed to $52 or above a few times recently, but seems to always meet resistance. The price fell 4% by midday Monday back below $52 as investors fretted about possible economic softness in Asia after Caterpillar Inc. CAT and Nvidia Corporation NVDA both reported Asian weakness affecting their businesses. Any sign of a hiccup in China, or a sense that U.S./China trade talks aren’t progressing, has tended to weigh on crude prices in recent months. Another factor could be a rise last week in the number of active U.S. rigs. As of mid-January, 112 more rigs were active than a year earlier, according to Baker Hughes. That’s despite crude prices actually falling slightly over that time period. Some oil industry analysts have pointed out that U.S. operators in places like the Permian Basin are actually able to make profits at oil prices even lower than the ones we’re seeing, so it’s unclear if the continued weak crude market would cut much into U.S. output.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

23,30,AAPL,Foxconn Moves Manufacturing Out Of China,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13056495,"Apple Inc's AAPL manufacturing partner Foxconn Technology Group, which assembles Apple's iPhone product in China, announced on Saturday that it has raised over $213 million for what it described as a ""mega-development"" in India. According to Bloomberg, the investment signals that Foxconn is moving the manufacturing of Apple products out of China.Henry Byers, director of pricing and partnerships at Steam Logistics, said that the current trade dispute between the U.S. and China accelerated the process of some manufacturers moving their supply chains from China to lower-wage countries like India. This will enable manufacturers to report those countries as the ""country of origin"" of their products and potentially avoid U.S. import tariffs on Chinese goods implemented by the Trump Administration.""The bigger you are in terms of market-share volume, the more exposed you are to have your manufacturing and assembly all in one country."" said Byers.Byers said that Foxconn and other manufacturers have considered redirecting their supply chains to support manufacturing operations in countries including India and Vietnam for years. Wages have grown in China due to the country's overall economic growth, causing labor-intensive manufacturing like the assembly of the iPhone to become more expensive. Byers said global economic history shows that the manufacturing sector will leave high-wage countries and move to low-wage countries.""The first thing they've [manufacturers] done is really look at the assembly plants, and then export raw materials and component goods out of China to Vietnam and have them assembled there,"" said Byers. Don't miss it. Register today.India, Vietnam and other lower-wage economies have received more attention from global manufacturing supply chains as they've opened their markets to foreign trade and investment.According to a September 2018 report by McKinsey & Company, Vietnam's manufacturing sector grew from 16 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2009 to 21 percent of its GDP in 2016. Foxconn, along with Intel, Samsung and Wintek have invested $15 billion in production facilities and partnerships with Vietnamese manufacturers. McKinsey also found that Vietnamese exports increased 14 percent per year between 1996 and 2016 while the market capitalization of listed companies grew 9 percent per year during the same time period.According to the report, Vietnam has been able to attract foreign, private capital through its rapid transition from a socialist economy to a deregulated capitalist economy. The McKinsey report also said that China's focus on becoming a more capital-intensive (less labor through automation) manufacturing market would send labor-intensive manufacturing to countries where labor is cheaper.Manufacturers of labor-intensive goods also want to reduce the exposure associated with China's declining economic growth. China's slowing economy hurt Apple's sales and performance recently.""They [manufacturers] want to diversify more."" said Ibrahiim Bayaan, chief economist at FreightWaves. ""Part of this is tariff-related. The other part has to do with the slowing of the Chinese economy. With growth slowing there, it affects their [manufacturers'] revenues. It's likely that this will affect many electronics companies, and the longer the trade war with the U.S. continues, the more companies will feel pressure to relocate out of China.""In terms of exports, the McKinsey report said that Vietnam's share of the labor-intensive manufacturing market grew by 1.5 percent, from 4.5 percent in 2014 to 6 percent in 2016. This made Vietnam the fastest-growing exporter of labor-intensive manufactured goods and the third-largest exporter of labor-intensive goods after China at 53 percent (down from 56 percent during that period) and India at 9 percent. India had the second-largest share growth in the labor-intensive manufacturing market at 0.7 percent between 2014 and 2016.However, despite these developments and the recent decreases, these figures also show that China is still the largest player by far in the labor-intensive manufacturing market.Want more content like this?

24,31,AAPL,How To Approach Q4 Earnings: The Technical Perspective,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13057960,"Earnings season is in full swing and the market has seemingly been unfazed by what might otherwise be impactful report deliveries. Things like a disappointing bottom line report from Netflix, Inc. NFLX and extremely mixed signals from financials like Wells Fargo WFC and Citigroup, Inc. C have done little to disrupt the overall momentum that has carried the market higher through most of January.Technically, the S&P 500 is in a very interesting spot relative to its long term pattern. In mid-January, the index approached to within a percent of its 2018 entrance price after losing all of last year’s gains over the final months of 2018.January’s gains put the index at a level its gotten very familiar with, a phenomenon that becomes clear in the chart below, taken stock research platform Finscreener.The S&P 500 revisited that level, just under 2670, several times throughout 2018. In those times, volatility skyrocketed, but the index ultimately lurched forward until the next dramatic fall. That trend is seemingly repeating itself, with the volatility index climbing about 10 percent in the week starting in the approach to 2670.Its difficult to predict what hitting this level once again might mean for the broad market, but individual stocks could provide an indication of the patterns forming around this larger trend. With the help of Finscreener’s technical summary tools, we’ll take a look at the technical health of a few S&P stocks set to report in the final week of the month.Below is a list of companies due to report the week of January 27, alongside their technical ratings based on moving averages and overall technical health.The strongest positive technical signals emerging from the chart are the daily and weekly moving averages. Within that trend, there are a couple pairs of companies that share same industry, like Mastercard Inc. MA and Visa Inc. V and Merck & Co., Inc. MRK and Pfizer Inc. PFE, whose technical health puts them in a strong position to react to their counterparts’ results.However, the technical outlook on traditional market leaders like Apple Inc. AAPL and Facebook Inc. FB is decidedly negative across the board. While earnings beat could likely help to shift the near-term chart trend, the overall trajectory of these stocks might still be negative should volatility persist.On the other hand, mega caps Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Boeing Co. BA, which are up YTD 10.4 and 13 percent respectively, both have an overall “Buy” rating based on their weekly technicals. Strong numbers from either will likely reverberate through the broad market, although growth prospects for Amazon have diminished in recent quarters, which might be reflected in their Q4 report, and Boeing has already felt a lift from United Technologies Corporation UTX strong report the previous week that could mute even a solid set of results.While the broad market's long term trend might pose some resistance as the last leg of earnings roll out, those numbers might tip the scale as to whether the market can break its historical levels, or if equity is in store for more uncertainty as 2019 unfolds.",2019-01-29

Apple Q1 EPS $4.18, Sales $84.31B

Net Cash Balance At End Of Q1 $130B
Apple, which had become the first $1-trillion company last summer, had already set expectations lower for a disappointing quarter due to sluggish iPhone sales, lowering its revenue forecast one month ago.""While it was disappointing to miss our revenue guidance, we manage Apple for the long term, and this quarter's results demonstrate that the underlying strength of our business runs deep and wide,"" CEO Tim Cook said in the release.ProductsApple said iPhone revenue dropped 15 percent from the prior year. But all other revenue grew 19 percent, and services revenue reached a record $10.9 billion, up 19
percent from the prior year.Revenue from the company's Mac computers, Wearables, and Home and Accessories also reached all-time highs, growing 9 percent and 33 percent, respectively, Apple said. Revenue from iPad grew 17 percent.The report came without specific numbers on iPhone sales, following Apple’s announcement in November that it will no longer report unit sales for the signature iPhone, or for Macs and iPads.Apple officials have said services — such as App store downloads — are a better indicator of how the company is performing. It's a market the company believes is a big part of its future as the smartphone market becomes saturated.What's NextCook hit on the shift to Apple as a service model that many believe the company wants to focus on.""Our active installed base of devices reached an all-time high of 1.4 billion in the first quarter, growing in each of our geographic segments. That's a great testament to the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers, and it's driving our Services business to new records thanks to our large and fast-growing ecosystem.""The earnings print followed a report over the weekend that Apple's contract iPhone manufacturer, Foxconn Technology Group, will move manufacturing out of China and to a new production facility in India.Click here to see how Apple shares typically move following an earnings print.Related Links:Apple Lowers Revenue Expectations As China's Market SlowsApple Earnings Preview: Investors Brace For Update On Turbulent Quarter Marred By iPhone WeaknessPhoto courtesy of Apple. ",2019-01-29

27,37,AAPL,"Apple, Boeing And The Fed: A Full Day Ahead As Earnings Help Recharge Wall Street",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13065038,"When it’s Fed day the market sometimes stays pretty static as investors await a decision from Washington.Wednesday might be the exception. Things are running hot, with major indices higher in pre-market trading as investors digest earnings from Apple Inc. AAPL and Boeing Co BA. These two behemoths both surprised to the upside, with BA’s numbers looking especially strong. BA shares rose more than 5% ahead of the opening bell, while AAPL shares climbed 4.6%.Earlier this week, Caterpillar Inc's CAT earnings appeared to raise concerns about the industrials and how they might respond to weakness in China. The good news coming out of AAPL and BA could help mitigate those concerns. That doesn’t mean they’ll go away completely, but maybe they’re not as bad as people thought.BA’s report, in particular, might hold hopes for the overall market. The stock is often seen as a proxy for global economic performance, China included. Many companies reporting so far this earnings season have mentioned Chinese economic slowing as a drag, but the BA earnings might suggest that at least some U.S. multinationals can do fine anyway.Many overseas markets rose earlier Wednesday, while crude continued to inch higher and gold also headed up (see chart below). The Fed comes out with its decision early this afternoon, but futures prices point to essentially no chance of a rate change.Apple, Boeing Spread CheerAfter what seemed like one piece of bad news after another over the last few months—including lowering its quarterly revenue projection in early January—Apple delivered some positive tidings after Tuesday’s close. Earnings and revenue for the company’s fiscal Q1 both came in above third-party consensus expectations, with earnings per share of $4.18 beating analyst estimates by a penny and revenue of $84.3 billion also just above expectations of $84 billion.It wasn’t all rosy, as iPhone revenue came in just under the Street’s expectations and fell 15% from a year ago. Still, revenue in the closely watched services segment rose 29% year over year. Probably less than shocking was AAPL’s weak performance in China last quarter, considering that AAPL had already warned investors about revenue there being worse than it had previously expected. Sales in the Greater China region fell 27%, while Europe and Japan sales also ticked lower. However, sales in the Americas rose 5%, the company said. During its conference call, executives reiterated that two headwinds remain weaker economic conditions in China and people waiting longer to replace their iPhones. Another headwind is dollar strength, AAPL noted.These factors might be eating into AAPL’s guidance. Apple expects revenue of $55 billion to $59 billion for the March quarter, below the average consensus estimate of $59.98 billion, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the number of iPhones sold in the March period will decline at the steepest level in the company’s history, The Wall Street Journal reported.It seems like some of those negatives got shaken off in pre-market trading. It might have helped that AAPL CEO Tim Cook said on the call that he believes there’s “a bit more optimism in the air” on U.S./China relations, according to media reports. The two countries are entering another round of trade negotiations this week. There also seems to be a sense in the analyst community that maybe some of the worst AAPL news has already been digested, judging from some of the analyst reports out today.The news from BA was less checkered. There’s not much to look at cross-eyed here. Earnings of $5.48 shattered the third-party consensus view of $4.58, while revenue of $28.34 billion also came in well above expectations and was up 14% year over year. Maybe the most important thing to note about BA is that profit margin was up 12% year over year. That is massive, and that might be what people are drawn to right away.BA also forecast 2019 earnings per share well above analysts’ expectations, and sees record commercial airplane deliveries. That might be read as a sign of continued firm demand for commercial air travel.  It could be interesting to tune into some of BA’s call with analysts to get executives’ take on the global economy and what’s driving all this enthusiasm for new airplanes. The company’s defense business also looked good.Up Next: Fed DecisionThe Fed is expected to issue its decision on interest rates at 2 p.m. ET today. Typically, there doesn’t tend to be a lot of price movement in the major indices on days when the Fed looms. However, with the futures market predicting virtually no chance of a hike, perhaps the pending decision might not be as big a deal as, say, a month ago.One thing that could potentially cause some volatility later is Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference. Many investors are probably curious to hear what sort of tone Powell might take and whether it will correlate with somewhat dovish statements that both he and other Fed officials have been making since the last Fed meeting. Until this month, the Fed was arguably among the primary sources of volatility in the markets as many investors worried that four rate hikes last year might have rates positioned too high even as the global economy slowed. Now, with few investors expecting another hike until much later this year, if at all, according to futures prices and surveys (see more below), the Fed has become kind of secondary in many investors’ thinking. That could change, naturally, depending on circumstances and data. Inflation data recently has appeared pretty benign, so it might be interesting to hear what the Fed has to say about possible reasons behind that.Powell’s language at the press conference might help investors get a better sense of where he stands not only on future rate action, but also on how the Fed might handle its balance sheet going forward. Media reports since last Friday have hinted that the Fed might slow the runoff of its bond holdings. If that’s the case, there’s a chance it could help keep borrowing costs down. There’s some debate in the analyst community about whether or not the Fed might provide a balance sheet strategy update today.Treasury Yields Fall Ahead of FedSpeaking of borrowing costs, they fell again Tuesday (see chart) as some investors once again seemed more willing to embrace “defensive” parts of the market. The 10-year yield slipped to 2.7%, down from near 2.8% at its high earlier this month. While the lower yields appeared to weigh on financials, the industrial sector topped the sector leaderboard Tuesday ahead of BA earnings and as investors seemed to appreciate results from Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT and 3M Co MMM.Most major indices fell on Tuesday, though the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) managed slight gains amid strength in components like Pfizer Inc. PFE and MMM. Earnings reports from both seemed to get some love despite including a few disappointing elements. Lately, it seems like companies are getting forgiven more often than not for guidance or financial misses.A lot of companies—including MMM and AAPL—have warned investors about a slowdown in China having an impact on their businesses. However, shares of both have been rising.  Could it be that at least some investors are starting to feel that China weakness might already be built into some companies’ stock prices? We’ll have to wait and see.More earnings lie ahead. Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Visa Inc V, and Tesla Inc TSLA are all scheduled to report after the close today. Tomorrow brings MasterCard Inc MA, General Electric Company GE, and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, among others. Also on tap Thursday: Ferrari NV RACE, which might give a sense of how the high rollers are spending their money these days.The week doesn’t get any less hectic when Friday rolls around. We wake up that morning to the January payrolls report (see more below).Figure 1: Easing Off: U.S. 10-Year Treasury yields (candlestick) have eased over the last week heading into today’s Fed meeting. However, gold (purple line) has shot up to over $1,300 an ounce, which some analysts say might be related to uncertainty over Brexit. Data Source: CME Group, Cboe Global Markets. Chart Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Jobs Data Loom Friday: Amid all the earnings and today’s Fed meeting conclusion, it’s also a big week for economic data. Arguably there’s none more important than Friday’s January payrolls report, especially since today’s Q4 gross domestic product (GDP) estimate was delayed by the shutdown (it’s unclear when that will be ready, but media reports suggest an average third-party estimate for GDP growth of 2.6%). Anyway, as payrolls approach, we’re coming off a huge job gain of 312,000 in December, along with average wages rising 3.2% year over year. That wage rise was up from 3.1% the prior month, and might bear watching because continued wage gains—while good news for workers—sometimes spark inflation worries. For January, analysts expect payroll growth to ease back quite a bit from December, to just 160,000 according to a Briefing.com survey. It’s unclear if the jobs report might reflect any impact from the long government shutdown, but it seems possible. Average hourly earnings are seen rising 0.2% month over month, Briefing.com said, down from 0.4% in the prior report.Month on Positive Path: With just today and tomorrow left in January, the year seems like it’s off to a relatively strong start for U.S. stocks. That’s especially the case if you look beyond the big three indices to some of the less closely followed ones, like transports and small caps, that some analysts believe can sometimes tell more about the health of the underlying economy. Going into Wednesday, the Dow Jones Transportation Average ($DJT) was easily outpacing the S&P 500 (SPX), up more than 8% year to date. It had another strong day Tuesday despite a drop in the SPX.  So far this quarter, there have been some surprisingly positive earnings and optimism from major airlines. In their earnings calls, none of the airlines have been mentioning any worries about tariffs or crude oil prices. Some rail and shipping companies have also had a good month on the charts, perhaps a sign of U.S. consumers remaining in relatively good health despite the government shutdown.Investors Assess Rate Hike Odds for 2019: A rate hike would seem pretty unlikely today, judging from how the futures market is shaping up, but that doesn’t necessarily mean we’re out of the woods for the year. A CNBC survey of investors released Tuesday showed 78% expect at least one rate hike before the end of 2019. In addition, 48% expect a hike next year. However, now there’s also a column in the survey for possible rate cuts, with 17% of respondents expecting the Fed to ease rates this year and 37% expecting that next year. One thing investors surveyed by CNBC agreed about was today’s Fed meeting. There are 100% expectations for no rate moves.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

28,38,AAPL,"World's Largest Company? It's Microsoft Again, And It Reports Wednesday",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13065150,"How the tables have turned.Less than six months ago, a look at the top-three companies by market capitalization would have shown Apple Inc. AAPL in first place with its then-$1 trillion market cap, followed by Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Google parent Alphabet GOOG.At that time, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, once the poster child for huge U.S. tech companies and the first public company to reach $500 billion in market cap way back in 1999, sat in fourth place on the list. However, that was before a Q4 that proved very harsh on the three leaders, and now MSFT once again holds first place on the leaderboard.It’s not as though MSFT stock didn’t have its struggles toward the end of 2018. Like most of the tech sector, MSFT found its shares under pressure. However, they generally held up far better than rivals, perhaps in part because MSFT reported fiscal Q1 earnings for the quarter ended in September that easily beat analysts’ estimates, while the AMZNs and AAPLs of the world generally disappointed investors with their guidance in the same period. MSFT shares fell 11% between Sept. 30 and the end of the year, but were up about 3% so far in 2019 through late Tuesday. AAPL shares, in contrast, fell 30% in Q4.MSFT comes back with fiscal Q2 earnings on Wednesday after the close. The company is expected to report earnings per share of $1.09, according to third-party consensus estimates, up from $0.96 a year ago. Analysts expect the company to report fiscal Q2 revenue of $32.49 billion, up 12.4% from the same quarter a year earlier.FIGURE 1: TOP DOG. Microsoft shares (candlestick) have been outpacing those of Apple (AAPL - purple line) and Alphabet (GOOG - blue line) over the past six months, helping propel MSFT back to the top of the market capitalization chart. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Riding the Cloud; Skies of AzureThough MSFT’s cloud business is likely to once again draw the most headlines when the company reports, its biggest segment is More Personal Computing—which includes Windows, devices, gaming products like Xbox and search ads. In fiscal Q1, this business line produced $10.7 billion in revenue, up 15% year over year, beating analysts’ estimates. Whatever else MSFT does, the health of this segment might seem to loom large in Q2.Another business that throws major weight around at MSFT is its Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Office, LinkedIn and Dynamics. This segment accounted for just over $9.8 billion in Q1 revenue, up 19% year over year.The Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes server products and cloud services, grew 24% in Q1 with $8.6 billion in revenue, according to the company’s Q1 release. MSFT’s biggest growth driver, according to some analysts, is its Azure public cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Azure saw a slight slowdown in growth in Q1, to 76% from 89% in Q4. Any further slowing of growth in Q2 might bring up some questions, but when you’re dealing with growth levels this high, comparisons might start to get tough. MSFT hasn’t broken out revenue for Azure, so it’s hard to say exactly how big an impact it’s having on the overall business. MSFT said FY Q1 Azure growth was in line with its own expectations.Because Azure is in the spotlight, MSFT shares sometimes move quickly after earnings based simply on results of this business, so investors might want to consider closely watching this particular number. MSFT shares fell 2% in the immediate aftermath of fiscal Q1 earnings as investors absorbed the lower Azure growth number, but then jumped back as investors pored over the rest of the company’s data.Microsoft says it has a hybrid cloud strategy, which includes sales of on-premises server products as well cloud services through Azure. Some analysts say this helps position MSFT well to take advantage of the overall transition toward cloud computing. As of fiscal Q1, Azure still appeared to be somewhat behind AWS in terms of percentage of cloud market sales, according to analysis firms quoted by the media. If Azure growth continues to slow, that could very well become a key focus of Wednesday’s conference call.One thing to consider watching is whether MSFT continued to increase Azure bookings during the quarter, as it said it did in fiscal Q1. This can be an imprecise way of measuring demand growth.However, investors might risk getting too wrapped up in Azure and miss other parts of the business. Fiscal Q1 saw LinkedIn revenue grow 33%, while gaming revenue rose 44%. Also, Surface revenue, which had been stagnant for a while, grew 14% in fiscal Q1, in part because of new models becoming available.Since MSFT is now the biggest company by market-cap in the world (at least for the moment), management’s insight on the global economy might be an important aspect for investors to monitor in the earnings call. Other companies reporting so far this earnings season have said softness in China’s economy is affecting their business, so it might be worth listening to see if MSFT saw any impact from this, as well.Options ActivityAs of Tuesday afternoon, the day before the earnings release, options traders have priced in a 4.2% ($4.34) stock move in either direction around the coming earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim® platform.Weekly option activity has concentrated on the call side, notably at the 105, 108 and 110 strikes.

33,43,AAPL,"Patience And Pause: Fed Holds Rates Steady, Dials Back Hawkish Language",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13068411,"Fed officials recently began talking about a “pause” for interest rates. Wednesday’s decision to keep rates unchanged and to remove some hawkish language from its previous statement might indicate the “pause” is underway.It wasn’t just the decision to keep rates unchanged. It’s also some language missing from the statement. The words, “further gradual increases” in rates, which appeared to spark fear when they appeared in Fed’s language last month, were conspicuously absent this time.In addition, a word that’s popped up a lot lately in Fed speeches appeared in the statement as well: “Patient.” Overall, the statement looked dovish.“In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient,” the statement read. The phrase, “muted inflation pressures” was another new addition not seen in the previous Fed statement, and also sounded less hawkish.The Fed also issued a special statement on its balance sheet, which has come into focus over the last week as some economists debate whether the Fed’s unwinding of this portfolio of bonds and other assets might be slowing the economy by pushing up borrowing costs. The jury is still out on that, but the Fed appeared to try to ease concerns, saying it’s “prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments.”The Fed, which has been letting $50 billion per month of securities run off its balance sheet, also said it would have an “ample” supply of bank reserves. That could indicate it still plans to have a large balance sheet even when it’s finished pruning it. Last month, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell seemed to spook some investors when he spoke about a “substantially smaller” balance sheet.A “Solid,” Not “Strong” EconomyThe central bank called U.S. economic activity, “solid,” a change from “strong” in the December statement. That might speak to the Fed detecting signs of slowing in the economy. It noted that its inflation gauges “have moved lower in recent months.”How do you define “solid” vs. “strong?” One thought is that solid means more consistent, but strong means, “we’re really rolling along.” If strong is equivalent to a “five-star” rating, maybe solid is four stars.The Fed did keep language from last time saying that the labor market “continues to strengthen” and that “job gains have been strong, on average.” Household spending, it said, “has continued to grow strongly.” None of this has changed from the December statement, and all of it would appear to support contentions that the U.S. economy is still in good shape.Today’s rate decision probably wasn’t much of a surprise to most investors, considering the futures market had pegged chances of a hike at just 1% going into the meeting. Fed Chair Powell and other Fed officials telegraphed pretty convincingly over the last month that a pause might be in order, and not just for this one meeting, either.Investors who got used to the Fed raising rates every quarter in 2018 might have to adjust to a little less excitement. Some analysts are comparing this to the “pause” of 2016, when the Fed waited an entire year to raise rates after doing so in December 2015. It was seen at the time as sort of a test of how the economy would react to a slight tightening after years of rates being essentially zero.Rates are much higher now than they were then, and there was widespread concern in December when the Fed upped the target range for its benchmark funds rate to the current 2.25% to 2.5%. At that time, a lot of economists had warned the Fed that it might want to consider leaving things alone considering slowing economies overseas and signs of U.S. growth easing. Those economists didn’t convince Powell and company, who voted unanimously for the hike. In the press conference following that meeting, Powell appeared to spook at least some investors when he talked about the balance sheet reduction program being “on autopilot.” Investors read that as an indication of further tightening, and the market tanked.That’s quite a different reaction from the market’s response to today’s Fed statement. The S&P 500 Index (SPX) recently was up 43 points, or 1.6%, for the session. A lot of the gains came earlier based on strong earnings from Apple Inc. AAPL and Boeing Co BA, but the Fed news appeared to spur some additional buying vigor.The Two Ps: Pause and PatienceAfter the December Fed meeting, the central bank’s language started to change toward a more dovish tone. Most Fed speakers over the last month seem to be reading from the same hymnal, and the operative words arguably have been “pause” and “patience.” Those were some of the takeaways from speeches earlier in January by Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan and Kansas City Fed President Esther George. According to Kaplan, it would be “wise to be patient” for the Fed, he told reporters. He said the Fed should be thinking in terms of “months, not weeks.”George, meanwhile, said, “A pause in the normalization process would give us time to assess.” That might have seemed like a bit of a surprise coming from George, who some analysts describe as typically rather hawkish. Powell himself said the Fed will be “patient.”After the Fed announcement today, futures prices indicated chances for another hike at 1% for the March meeting, and less than 10% for the June meeting. The market pegs odds of rates rising before the end of 2019 at just around 15%. That’s quite a change from where things were a few months ago, when many investors appeared to expect two rate hikes this year.In his press conference immediately after the decision, Powell said the case for raising rates has “weakened.” He added that monetary policy is “appropriate” and in the range of the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) estimates of neutral. That would mean rates at a level that neither would spark additional economic activity nor suppress growth.Asked at the press conference if the Fed might quickly change course if it started to see inflation flare up, Powell said there’s “no need for a rush to judgment,” though he emphasized the Fed, as always, would pay close attention to inflation as well as other data. This might help soothe investors going into Friday’s payrolls report, as recent data have shown a strong rise in hourly wages.How long is the Fed prepared to be patient? Powell was asked this at the press conference but declined to mention a timeframe. “The length of this patient period will depend entirely on incoming data...so it’s hard to label it,” Powell said.A Delicate BalanceJust last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Fed officials are closer to ending the central bank’s bond portfolio wind-down. If the Fed stops shrinking its $4 trillion portfolio of bonds and other assets, that could be another path toward keeping borrowing costs low and providing economic stimulus. The question is whether that’s needed, as U.S. consumers seem healthy and earnings continue to grow, though that growth is expected to slow quite a bit this year compared with 2018.The rest of the world’s economy, however, isn’t doing as well (see more below), which could put the Fed in a tough position. It wouldn’t want to do anything to slow the U.S. economy if it’s already being dragged by overseas weakness, but if it’s too loose in its policy, a strong U.S. economy could conceivably start to feel the heat of inflation. Wages rose 3.2% in December from a year earlier, and unemployment remains below 4%.The Fed’s recent more dovish vibe seemed to calm down the market a bit after the interest rate scare last fall when the 10-year Treasury yield jumped above 3.2%. It’s now trading around 2.7%. With worries about Fed tightening perhaps less of a factor, market volatility has eased over the last few weeks. The VIX—the market’s most influential “fear indicator”—traded under 19 early Wednesday after topping 30 a month ago.FIGURE 1: SEAS OF RED AND GREEN. After bottoming out in late December, the S&P 500 Index (SPX - candlestick) began its march higher through the January Fed meeting. Meanwhile, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes (TNX - purple line) bounced in early January and leveled off near 2.7%. Data sources: S&P Dow Jones Indices, Cboe Global Markets.

Past performance does not guarantee future results.  Uncertainty Drives Gold, Also Underpins Dollar: Common wisdom around markets is that gold and dollar often have an inverse relationship. When one rises, the other tends to fall. Well, gold has been on a tear since last September, but the dollar shows no signs of packing it in. This could reflect all the geopolitical balls in the air that appear to be driving some investors toward what they might see as “safer” investments, though no investment is ever truly safe. There’s Brexit, U.S./China trade negotiations, a deadline in mid-February for another potential U.S. government shutdown, and turmoil in oil-producing Venezuela. Typically, uncertainty tends to support gold prices. Since the end of September, gold is up about 10%, reaching $1,310 an ounce early Wednesday compared with below $1,200 back then.  Over that same period, the U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) is essentially unchanged, still trading between 95 and 96. Brexit’s potential impact on the pound might be a factor supporting the dollar despite gold market strength. One thing to consider watching, however, is central bank policy. The Fed and other major central banks are sounding more dovish, so we’ll have to wait and see if that starts to weigh more on the dollar, as looser monetary policy sometimes does.Fed Lacks 20/20 Vision This Time: The Fed came to its decision today lacking information it normally would have. That’s because the government shutdown, which ended last week, prevented release of some key data. These include Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and December personal income and outlays,  as well as a December trade report. The Fed typically keeps a close eye on these numbers, so in effect, it was flying slightly blind this time out. When Q1 GDP ultimately comes out this spring, it might be interesting to see if it reflects any impact from the shutdown. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said this week that the shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, including a permanent $3 billion loss. The CBO also projected economic growth will slow this year to 2.3%, compared with 3.1%  last year, as benefits of the new tax law begin to fade. A Look Across the Pond: As investors ponder the next possible move by the Fed, some might look to Europe for some additional insight. Earlier this month the rate on the German 10-yr Bund sank to its lowest level in nearly two years, and as of today sits at a mere 0.188%. Recall that the German benchmark interest rate spent a chunk of 2016 on the negative side.Though the European Central Bank (ECB) recently announced a phase-out of its $2.9 trillion bond-buying program, this week ECB President Mario Draghi said the central bank “stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the governing council’s inflation aim.” With the latest eurozone inflation reading clocking in at a less-than-robust 1.6%, and with the ECB having just pushed its next expected rate hike out to mid-2020 (from late 2019), it seems the “pause-and-patience” approach is occurring on both sides of the Atlantic.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

35,45,AAPL,"Earnings, Volatility, Brexit Are Key Topics Heading Into February",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13077426,"February could bring a heaping plate of geopolitical drama to markets around the world, potentially helping to end a brief calm that settled over January.As the month starts, markets were basking in the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold interest rates steady, along with better than expected earnings results from Boeing Co BA and Apple Inc AAPL. In fact, many Wall Street analysts have indicated they now expect no interest rate increase at all this year after the Fed said it will remain “patient.” So stocks begin February propelled in part by the ongoing earnings season and the Fed’s dovish tone.Still, several question marks hover over the next few weeks. First, the U.S. and China only have about four weeks until their self-imposed early March deadline to get some sort of trade agreement in the books, or we could see tariffs jump. Of course, any more trade tension could likely put the market in a tailspin in both countries and perhaps around the world. As of late January, optimism seeped in around positive developments, but there was no word of an imminent deal.That’s just one reason why volatility—which surged in December as investors fretted about a possible global economic slowdown—could once again become a factor into February. The markets spent January recovering from December’s sell-off, but as a new month begins nothing is certain. Even the government shutdown—which ended with stopgap funding through Feb. 15—could resurface if lawmakers don’t agree on an immigration and border security deal.As of late January, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) was up approximately 7% year to date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) was up about 7.2% and the Nasdaq (COMP) was up 8.2%. At the end of last year, key sectors like info tech, financials, and transports had remained under pressure, signs that investors apparently had doubts about U.S. and global economic growth. But those sectors showed much more buoyancy throughout January. The fact that COMP is leading the major indices might be an early sign of investors starting to embrace more risk, since it’s dominated by tech and biotech names. In addition, the small-cap Russell 2000 (RUT) had the best start to a year since 1987. The market remains headline-driven, meaning the China “news du jour” might drive sentiment on any given day. Certain stocks that sometimes serve as bellwethers reflecting the ups and downs of negotiations— including Boeing and Caterpillar Inc. CAT—might be good ones to consider watching for hints about how the market as a whole sees the talks progressing as February rolls along.Brexit, Shutdown Add to Uncertainty However, it’s not just China negotiations echoing around the markets. February is set to begin with Europe and the U.K. still at odds over Brexit. This comes after a vote in January by the U.K. Parliament solidly rejected a compromise agreement put forward by British Prime Minister Theresa May. She survived a no-confidence vote later the same week. Now there’s talk of the U.K. possibly asking the E.U. for an extension of the March 29 exit date.Meanwhile, back in the U.S., a partial government shutdown that found a three-week resolution until Feb. 15 could be followed by more political tension as the investigation of Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election seems to be getting close to some kind of conclusion. This isn’t a political column, but any potential fireworks in Washington, D.C., can’t be discounted for their possible impact on the markets.Needless to say, geopolitics looks like it might continue to be a prime contributor to volatility in the stock markets, so the slight easing of market choppiness in the latter half of January shouldn’t necessarily be seen as an extended return to more placid times. The market’s most closely watched fear factor, the VIX, fell to below 18 by Jan. 30, well below the highs above 30 seen during December’s turbulent trading. Whether VIX can stay below 20 with all the politics on investors’ plates remains to be seen.Earnings Season Kicks Off on Mixed NoteEven without all the geopolitics, there’d probably be plenty for the market to absorb in February. Earnings season—which began in mid-January with some of the biggest U.S. banks and airlines giving somewhat mixed readings and retailers reporting disappointing holiday sales—grinds on. January’s bright spots in earnings, including from AAPL and BA, are helping to set an optimistic tone for February.Companies have been churning out market-pleasing results the past year, but keep in mind that this year, Wall Street’s expectations are a bit more tempered after recent softening guidance. In Q3, S&P 500 earnings growth was 22%, but might be just over 12% for Q4, according to research firm CFRA. With this next wave of releases, keep in mind that investors are likely to still be more interested in what companies have to say about their future performance as opposed to their current numbers. So far, if their stocks are any gauge, some companies have caused alarm with their guidance, while others have impressed.Banks actually began Q4 earnings season with arguably decent results. But Morgan Stanley MS then joined the chorus of banks reporting struggles with fixed income trading as Q4 earnings and revenue both fell short of estimates. Total revenue was down 10% year over year to $8.55 billion, short of the $9.3 billion the Street expected. MS, which also noted declines in its wealth management business, said that it saw softness in the weeks after Thanksgiving and its CFO said that the quarter ended “messily.”Some of the closely watched corporations scheduled to share results in early February include Alphabet Inc GOOG, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, General Motors Company GM, Tesla Inc TSLA, Walt Disney Co DIS, Twitter Inc TWTR, The CocaCola Co KO, and Eli Lilly And Co LLY. The month could give investors more insights into performance of key sectors including automobiles, chips, health care and consumer staples. Finally, retailers like Macy’s Inc M and Walmart Inc WMT are also on tap and could help shed some more light on how the holiday sales season fared through both brick-and-mortar locations and online channels. We’ve already seen December sales results from M and Nordstrom.com, Inc. JWN, which both were softer than expected, which could be because online retail is continuing to snag market share from traditional retail as holiday sales overall were fairly healthy.To stay on top of earnings news, visit The Ticker Tape Earnings page.Fed Takes a Backseat in Investor Concerns  The Fed won’t be absent from discussion either after concluding its January meeting, where it left rates unchanged.So far in 2019, U.S. economic data, especially inflation, has looked pretty benign. This, along with dovish remarks from various Fed officials, have some analysts reporting they expect a rather lengthy pause in further Fed tightening. While investors will probably want to continue monitoring data in February, especially the January jobs report early in the month, that Fed brake pedal hanging over the market all of 2018 appears to be a little less of a factor, at least for now.With the Fed widely expected to take a less hands-on approach in the first half of the year, one economic market that might be worth a more careful look is the U.S. dollar.Last year, the dollar went on a wild ride from multi-year lows early on to 18-month highs by December as the Fed continued to tighten the screws. The wildcard here, however, might be Brexit. If March approaches and there’s still no sign of a clear Brexit off-ramp for the U.K., that could pressure the pound and potentially the euro, with the possibility that some investors now parking money in those currencies or European bonds might seek protection in the greenback or U.S. Treasuries.Treasuries Buck Economic TrendsSpeaking of Treasuries, that’s a market that appears to have some economists scratching their heads as February approaches.Despite continued robust U.S. economic data, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was just above 2.7% in late January, down about 50 basis points from last fall’s highs. At these levels, it seems the fixed-income market is predicting a good deal of U.S. economic slowdown in 2019, but most analysts still project decent growth. In late February, the government is scheduled to release its second look at Q4 gross domestic product (GDP), but this is a backward-looking indicator. Investors might want to keep an eye on the Federal Reserve of Bank of Atlanta’s GDP Now site throughout February to get a sense of how Q1 growth is shaping up, particularly in light of the long government shutdown. That site was not updating during the recent government shutdown, but hopefully will be back up soon. Also, the initial estimate on Q4 GDP from the government got delayed, and now might be coming out in February.Meanwhile, keep an eye on crude oil prices, which rebounded in January from below $50 per barrel to above $54 per barrel. Oil prices are still well off their October prices of above $76 per barrel, but lately they seem to be responding well to broader positive economic signs and hopes for a resolution in the U.S.-China tariff standoff, as well as supply concerns as the U.S. imposes sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.It’s Not Too Early to Prepare for Tax SeasonTaxes may not be due until April 15 this year, but you can still begin gathering documents and receipts you’ll need to file your 2018 returns. By February, most taxpayers will have already received their W-2 forms from their employers as employers are required by law to send them by Jan. 31.Remember, this year brings significant changes in the tax code that could affect how you file your taxes, including whether you will itemize or take the new standard deduction, which has roughly doubled. The time between now and filing day may also be the time for evaluating if you should make additional contributions to any IRAs or retirement accounts you may have for potential tax advantages. Finally, you can take some time to revisit your plan for contributing to your IRA or 401(k) plan as those maximum contribution limits have increased for 2019.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

36,46,AAPL,"January Markets: Fed Stays ""Patient"" And Earnings Brew",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13079882,"January saw stocks march steadily back to recoup much of the losses suffered since last fall’s record highs, with a flurry of major earnings including from Apple Inc AAPL and Boeing Co BA helping to keep up the momentum. In addition, the late-month Federal Reserve meeting further underscored the Fed’s generally dovish approach as it said it was set to hold rates steady. Many Wall Street analysts now believe a March hike is unlikely.Optimism about potential progress in U.S. talks with China, strengthening commodity prices and a general sense that the December sell-off might have been overdone all helped contribute to the stock market’s partial recovery. Volatility—which had spiked in late December—eased quite a bit in January as calmer markets prevailed. By late January, the S&P 500 (SPX) had moved above 2680, compared with a low near 2350 in December. The market’s main fear indicator, the VIX, fell to 18 as of Jan. 30 after scrambling above 30 a month earlier.Still, the month seemed charged with uncertainty as major geopolitical questions remained unanswered and consumer confidence appeared to waver.That said, there was still a lot up in the air as the month drew toward a close, and volatility often resurfaced on signs of any bad news. A U.S. partial government shutdown for most of the month had some investors worried about potential impact on economic growth. While the government has reopened with stopgap funding until Feb. 15, it’s still uncertain whether it will be funded after that, and by which budget deal.Finally, a series of tepid data out of Asia made clear that growth is slowing there. The European economy also appeared stuck in neutral, and there’s still no solution in sight for Brexit.Fed Emphasizes Patience in Interest Rate HikesThe Fed seemed to step back throughout January, with a series of speeches from key Fed officials indicating that the central bank might pause for a while and keep an eye on the data. That sentiment was hammered in at the Jan. 29 to Jan. 30 meeting, when the Fed held interest rates steady and expressed little urgency about the next increase.After four rate hikes in four quarters in 2018, the Fed meeting appeared to help give stocks a boost, with the SPX, Dow and the Nasdaq, all up around 2% in the aftermath. (Although robust earnings from AAPL and BA also contributed.) Lately, the Fed went from being a primary factor among investor concerns to more of a secondary one, and this might continue throughout the first half, barring a sudden inflation uptick.China Trade Optimism Helped Underpin Stock MarketThe January recharge came in part from hope that the U.S. and China could reach some sort of agreement. Positive developments included a set of talks early in the month that both sides called productive, and an offer by China to completely eliminate its trade surplus with the U.S. by 2024, according to news reports. China also offered to boost imports of U.S. goods (which it would probably have to in order to reduce that trade surplus), though the situation remains unresolved. Some sectors that might get a lift from that would include agriculture and energy.All this helped inject some optimism into the stock market around mid-month, and the SPX rose four weeks in a row. At the same time, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which got buried below 2.6% by late 2018 after reaching 3.2% earlier in the year was just above 2.7% as of Jan. 30.Surprisingly, corporate executives holding earnings calls with analysts through mid- and late-January didn’t really provide much clarity on how the China situation might affect their companies. That could be a sign that they’re as uncertain as the rest of us and simply waiting for more details. Whatever the case, the general tone on these calls seemed pretty conservative. It appears executives might be cooling their heels, not wanting to make big plans until they know how some of the geopolitical factors might play out. Conservative executives could lead to investors also taking a more conservative stance as the March 1 deadline draws near.Reporting Season Kicks Off With Mixed BagWith a wave of earnings churning into February, sentiment seemed to improve quite a bit from Q3 to Q4. Last year, almost any company reporting even minor negatives generally saw their stock get punished. January, on the other hand, kicked off with two of the biggest banks—J.P. Morgan Chase & Co JPM and Citigroup Inc C—missing at least one third-party consensus estimate for either earnings or revenue but still getting a stock market boost. Meanwhile, Bank of America Corp BAC and Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS posted impressive Q4 results, while Morgan Stanley MS appeared to disappoint.Financials suffered badly in the stock market last year, but that turned around a bit in January. Most of the major big banks saw softness in their trading businesses, but investors appeared to discount that and focus on better loan growth and wealth management numbers. Some of the regional banks reporting in January also seemed to perform well in Q4.By late January, the S&P 500 Financial sector was up almost 6.3% year-to-date, with AAPL and BA earnings in focus as both are considered bellwethers for the broader economy. AAPL reported Q1 earnings and revenue that topped the third-party consensus estimates, with growth in nearly every segment except iPhone sales, which were below expectations. As expected, AAPL revealed weakness in China as it had warned earlier this month.And BA’s earnings of $5.48 per share blew past third-party estimates for $4.58 per share as revenue was up 14% year over year. Perhaps most significantly, BA’s profit margin was up 12% year over year. The defense contractor also reported guidance well past analyst estimates thanks to growing expectations for commercial airplane deliveries.In other significant earnings this month, Caterpillar Inc. CAT shed some light on how China’s slowdown and the U.S.-China tariff situation may be affecting U.S. companies. The equipment manufacturer reported lower than expected Q4 earnings and guidance, citing in part both those factors as well as increasing freight and material costs as a result of tariffs. CAT plunged more than 9% as a result.Communication Services was another sector in the green as of late January, helped in part by Netflix, Inc. NFLX. The company’s shares rose nearly 40% between late December and late January as it announced a subscription price increase and reported a mostly better-than-expected quarter. However, revenue just missed analysts’ expectations.Consumers Getting Nervous?While NFLX might generate some optimism about consumer demand, there were also some warning signals that maybe not all is well at the shopping mall. Holiday sales figures released from Macy’s Inc M, Nordstrom, Inc. JWN, and Tiffany & Co. TIF all disappointed, hitting the consumer discretionary hard on certain days in January.Also, a bit of concern developed when the January University of Michigan Sentiment report headline number fell way short of Wall Street analysts’ expectations. The reading came in at 90.7, down from 98.3 in December and below the Briefing.com consensus of 96.0. The people surveyed in the report said they were concerned about the partial government shutdown, the impact of tariffs, instabilities in financial markets, the global slowdown, and the lack of clarity about monetary policies.Those consumer confidence numbers might put some investors on guard going into February. It appears that the geopolitical turmoil is starting to work itself into some folks’ shopping decisions. The U.S. partial government shutdown—which had 800,000 federal workers not getting paid and could begin again if there is no budget resolution next month—could even start to slow Q1 gross domestic product (GDP) growth.Crude Oil Hits Two-Month HighAnother development here was a jump in U.S. crude oil prices from lows of below $43 a barrel in late December to near $55 per barrel by Jan. 30, a two-month high. The crude market often can help pinpoint whether global economic growth is accelerating or skidding.This month, oil prices got boost from the U.S. sanction on Venezuela’s oil industry, which caused supply concerns. On top of that, U.S. crude inventories rose less than expected the week of Jan. 21, sending prices a bit higher.Risk Embrace Resumes, But For How Long?By late January, there was a growing sense that even with weak economic data out of China and the continued housing market softness in the U.S., there might be a chance for things to really improve if geopolitics would just get out of the way. This perception might have led to more “risk-on” type of trading.Back at the start of the month, it appeared that certain sectors might need to show leadership if the rally was going to grow some legs. By late January, it looked like some of the key sectors have come through. Leaders so far this year included some of the key cyclicals: Energy, financials, industrials, and consumer discretionary were the top performers year-to-date as of late in the month. All these sectors have outperformed the S&P 500 (SPX) since the end of December, perhaps a sign that some investors are starting to feel more comfortable embracing risk.Meanwhile, some of the so-called “defensive” sectors that helped lead in Q4, including utilities, health care, and staples, were all near the back of the pack so far in January. There’s still a long way to go in Q1 and the next news about trade with China could always conceivably be negative and help make people risk-averse again, but investors’ embrace of more aggressive stocks appears to be a positive sign.",2019-01-31
37,47,AAPL,"Jobs Report Beats Expectations, Adding To Week Of Market-Boosting Economic News",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13083540,"As a new month got underway, investors had their second helping of big economic news this week in the form of the government’s jobs report for January, which came after the Fed meeting earlier this week helped boost the market. For the second month in a row, job creation in the United States blew past expectations with a surge of more than 300,000 new nonfarm payrolls positions. A Briefing.com consensus estimate had forecast a gain of 160,000 jobs in January, but the actual figure from the Labor Department ended up showing a rise of 304,000.Still, there may be some factors that could temper enthusiasm about the bumper report. First, the 312,000 reading that had exceeded expectations in December was revised down to 222,000. That’s still above what Wall Street was expecting in last month’s initial report, but it takes some of the shine off. Also, the jobs data that show strength in the economy also point to potentially heightened inflationary pressure, which could, along with other data, prompt the Fed to revise its recently taken dovish stance. Indeed, the government said that annual average hourly earnings, a key component of inflation, increased by 3.2%.Ahead of the jobs report, manufacturing data out of China seemed to temper the bullish tone – from the Fed’s stance and a strong earnings season – a bit after the January Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index came in below expectations and posted its worst reading since February 2016. Asian markets were mixed after the news, as hopefulness about a U.S.-China trade deal helped buoy sentiment. President Trump told reporters Thursday that he hoped to get a deal done before the March deadline, and Chinese state media said negotiators from both sides have made “important progress” in solving an issue that has been a headwind for markets for months. Market Digests Fed News; Earnings ContinueThursday was the first full trading day after the Fed stood pat on interest rates, removed the words “further gradual increases” from its statement and reiterated the central bank’s more dovish stance amid its willingness to be patient about potential further rate hikes.After cheering the move following the announcement Wednesday, the U.S. stock market finished mostly higher Thursday. While the Fed’s monetary policy stance is important, as we’ve said before, earnings drive markets, and generally earnings have been showing positive signs.Facebook FB shares surged after the social media giant easily beat third-party consensus earnings and revenue expectations. FB said daily active user growth climbed 9% in the quarter to 1.52 billion, while monthly active user growth also rose 9%. The company did say it expects revenue growth to slow, but revenue rose at about a 30% clip in Q4, beating the company’s own guidance range.While FB was helping the S&P 500 (SPX) communication services sector post the day’s best sector gains, General Electric Company GE was leading the industrials sector higher. GE added to the generally positive tone to the market after it reported stronger-than-expected revenue, although its earnings per share came in under expectations. The rally in those two companies’ shares comes after Apple Inc. AAPL and Boeing Co BA surprised to the upside, seeming to help alleviate some worry about slowing growth in China. In corporate earnings news Friday morning, Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM shares gained ground after the company reported earnings that beat Wall Street estimates even as revenue fell short of expectations. Capex ConcernsAlthough the U.S.-China trade war has been a market overhang for months now, the extent to which the tariff tussle is holding back company executives in terms of making plans may be underrated.One notable issue during this earning season has been a relative absence of talk about capital expenditure plans. It seems likely that is because of the tariff uncertainty. So, if the China-U.S. trade dispute gets solved, it’s a possibility that capex may ramp up. While one-quarter with a dearth of capex is not too alarming, an extended absence of company spending would be.Some Earnings-Season CloudsNot all of this earnings season has been positive. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) ended just shy of the break-even mark on Thursday, weighed down by a hefty drop in DowDuPont Inc's DWDP shares after earnings came in slightly ahead of expectations, but revenue missed analysts’ forecast.And after the closing bell, Amazon.com, Inc.'s AMZN shared dipped substantially in extended trading hours Thursday after the online retailing giant provided an outlook that disappointed investors, even though it beat top- and bottom-line expectations after a bumper holiday season. Revenue at Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud-computing platform, also beat expectations.While much of the market’s strength at the moment appears to be coming from optimism about the Fed and strong corporate earnings, it’s also possible that some companies may have gotten oversold, creating what some see as a buying opportunity.But last month’s strength also brings to mind January 2018, when the market was on fire but then the bulls got doused in cold water amid a sharp pullback that carried into last February. One thing to potentially watch for is earnings reports from retailers. They could prove to be a headwind and a test for the resiliency of the current bullish momentum.Figure 1: Brexit and the Buck: The dollar gained ground against a basket of other currencies last year amid stock market volatility prompting flight-to-safety buying in the greenback, signs of strength in the U.S. economy, and multiple interest rate hikes by the Fed. What remains to be seen is whether the Brexit outcome might weigh on the pound and the euro enough to give the dollar another meaningful boost of support. Data Source: ICE Futures U.S.Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.More Strength for the Dollar?: With the deadline for Brexit approaching in March, one of the questions that has been hanging over the market is how that might affect Britain’s economy, and that of the European Union. Britain hasn’t yet passed a plan for the split. While no one knows exactly how a no-deal Brexit would play out, it’s arguable that the results wouldn’t be good for either economy, or at least not as good as they would be in a negotiated divorce. If the economies of Britain and the EU deteriorate meaningfully as a result of Brexit, that could weaken their currencies compared with the U.S. dollar. After strengthening though much of last year (see chart above), an even more muscular greenback could create a stronger headwind for U.S. multinationals by making the goods they sell more expensive for buyers using other currencies.From Supply to Demand: Oil prices took a beating last year, in part on concerns about oversupply amid a glut of production. But a deal from OPEC and Russia on curtailing production has helped prices rally, boosting the SPX energy sector more than 10% this year through Wednesday, according to investment research firm CFRA. That’s a sharp contrast to last year, when, according to the research firm, the sector fell more than 20%. But the sector isn’t out of the woods yet, as the International Monetary Fund has reduced its global economic growth expectations. “The uncertainty in the oil market has shifted from a supply side concern to a demand side question,” CFRA said.Consumers Less Confident: Earlier this week, a reading on the confidence of the U.S. consumer dropped more than expected. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index fell to 120.2 in January from a downwardly revised 126.6 in December. A Briefing.com consensus had expected the reading for last month to come in at 126.1. The mindset of consumers is a big deal because consumer spending represents the single largest contributor to the U.S. economy. “The outlook among consumers was dampened by the volatility in financial markets and the government shutdown, which threatens to register in consumer spending data that would be a drag on first quarter GDP,” Briefing.com said. Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

38,48,AAPL,"Chuck Schumer, Bernie Sanders Urge Limit On Corporate Buybacks",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13092849,"Two Democratic Party leaders penned an op-ed for the New York Times Sunday calling for new rules related to corporate buybacks. Senator and potential 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer collaborated on an article blaming excessive share buybacks as a contributing factor in the widening U.S. wealth gap.What Are Buybacks?When a company makes a profit, it has a handful of ways it can use its excess cash. It can choose to carry the cash on its balance sheet and potentially earn interest. It can use that cash to reinvest in the business via research and development, potential mergers and acquisitions or simply remodeling or revamping stores or equipment.According to Schumer and Sanders, roughly 80 percent of U.S. corporate profits are returned to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks.A company chooses to buy back its stock in an attempt to create value for its investors. Companies scoop up shares off the public market and retire them, reducing their stock’s total share count. Assuming the market cap of the stock remains the same, lowering the share count theoretically raises the share price. Reducing the share count also raises earnings per share, a common growth metric analysts and investors use to assess the financial health of a company.Problems With BuybacksShare buybacks hold two major problems, according to Sanders and Schumer. First, since 10 percent of the wealthiest Americans own 85 percent of all stocks, buybacks mostly directly benefit the wealthy.The second problem Sanders and Schumer have with buybacks is their opportunity cost, or what companies are choosing not to do when they focus on buybacks.“When corporations direct resources to buy back shares on this scale, they restrain their capacity to reinvest profits more meaningfully in the company in terms of R&D, equipment, higher wages, paid medical leave, retirement benefits and worker retraining,” Sanders and Schumer wrote.The two senators used Walmart Inc WMT and its $20-billion buyback program as an example. According to Sanders and Schumer, a $20-billion investment would have been more than enough for Walmart to raise its minimum wage to $15 per hour.Some companies are even laying off workers while carrying on with dividend payments and buybacks. From 2008 to 2017, when the economy was struggling to recover from the worst financial crisis in decades, U.S. companies spent a combined $4 trillion on buybacks, Schumer and Sanders said.To combat this issue, the senators plan to introduce a bill that would lay out a set of preconditions for companies wishing to launch a buyback program.“Our bill will prohibit a corporation from buying back its own stock unless it invests in workers and communities first, including things like paying all workers at least $15 an hour, providing seven days of paid sick leave and offering decent pensions and more reliable health benefits,” Sanders and Schumer wrote.Most Aggressive Buyback ProgramsDozens of companies and stocks could be impacted by the new legislation, but a handful of companies and their investors would be impacted most. The following are the five companies that have bought back the most stock over the past five years, according to Kiplinger:
Apple, Inc. AAPL: $208.6 billion.
Microsoft Corporation MSFT: $60.2 billion.
Wells Fargo & Co WFC: $46.8 billion.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM: $45.5 billion.
Oracle Corporation ORCL: $44.1 billion.

39,50,AAPL,Rolling Along: Better Than Expected Earnings Continue Driving Market Higher,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13102194,"The market is on a roll, driven by earnings-related momentum. Still, geopolitical questions continue to overhang. Meanwhile, volatility is at multi-month lows, as measured by the VIX. That “fear index” receded below 16 early this week from above 30 as recently as late December.It feels like there’s a cautious optimism on Wall Street as VIX continues to ease (see more below). Earnings season has been better than expected, and a lot of CEOs on the earnings calls have made nice forward-looking statements. However, many investors don’t seem to fully trust this rally, with the tariff situation still hanging out there in the balance. That’s brought a bit of nervousness in, and it probably won’t go away unless there’s some sort of trade deal.Tonight’s State of the Union speech might bring more clarity on trade and other issues like the looming deadline for an immigration deal to avoid another government shutdown. Meanwhile, there’s more earnings news to absorb with Walt Disney Co DIS, Ralph Lauren Corp RL, and Archer Daniels Midland Co ADM reporting today (more below). European markets hit nine-week highs Tuesday amid solid earnings news.In another apparently bullish development, last night’s dinner between President Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell appeared to spark more optimism about a Fed rate “pause.” The Fed issued a statement after the dinner basically re-emphasizing that rate decisions would be data-driven. This echoes what Powell and other Fed officials have been saying for the past month.Alphabet Shares Slide As Investors Ponder Costs, SpendingAfter Monday’s close, Alphabet Inc GOOG reported earnings and revenue that beat third-party consensus estimates, but shares lost a bit of ground in pre-market trading. GOOG’s financials ended the FAANG part of the earnings season, and those stocks had been outpacing the SPX so far this year going into the week (see more below). Though GOOG appeared to beat Street estimates for many of its key line items, pressure on the stock might have reflected investor concerns about the company’s costs and expenses, analysts said. Also, operating earnings fell a bit short of analyst projections. It might be worth considering, too, that shares had risen nearly 7% in just over two weeks leading up to earnings, meaning profit-taking on the news might have been another factor in the post-report selling.DIS is due to report after the close today, and analysts say it faces tough comparisons with a year ago. The thing investors might want to consider looking for is what DIS executives say about the future of Disney Plus, the company’s streaming service, coming on the back of Netflix, Inc. NFLX earnings. What are Disney’s plans for competing with NFLX? It’s a busy space, and a competitive one. Just yesterday, media reports said the FX Networks chief criticized how NFLX measures viewership.Shares of ADM slipped in pre-market trading as investors absorbed the company’s missing third-party consensus earnings and revenue estimates. The food processor’s press release referred to what it called “complicated and rapidly changing trade, geopolitical and market conditions.”However, apparel maker Ralph Lauren saw shares surge 8% in the pre-market hours after the company beat analysts’ estimates. RL’s performance can sometimes help investors get a sense of how high-end shoppers are doing.As the week continues, economic data look a bit thin. However, there was some on Monday and it didn’t particularly impress. Factory orders fell 0.6% in November, when a consensus of analysts by Briefing.com had predicted a 0.3% rise. On the plus side, November durable goods orders rose 0.7% after falling a dramatic 4.3% in October. Still, Briefing.com expressed concern that factory orders for December might also have been weak considering the big market sell-off that month and worries then about a government shutdown (which ended up taking place and lasting well into January).Tuning In Tonight for Possible Shutdown UpdateIt’s not too soon, maybe, to start thinking about possible impacts if there’s a second government shutdown. We have 10 days until the deadline, and President Trump makes his delayed State of the Union speech tonight. It wouldn’t be unheard of for the market to move based in part on a State of the Union, especially when you consider the possible ramifications on the economy if it looks like an immigration compromise might not be reached. Turning back to data, Monday saw the release of January’s Investor Movement Index® (IMXSM), which fell for a fourth-straight month to its lowest level since July 2012. The IMX—which measures what TD Ameritrade clients are actually doing and their exposure level to markets—appeared to reflect some ambiguity surrounding U.S.- China trade relations keeping investors in more defensive parts of the market.TD Ameritrade clients were once again net buyers during January. However, buying among equities was light, with clients gravitating toward less risky assets, including fixed-income products. This activity, along with decreasing relative volatility among widely held securities, including General Electric Company GE and Microsoft Corporation MSFT, helped push the IMX score lower.VIX Below 16Sixteen can be a meaningful number. For some, it might bring memories of birthday parties, or getting a driver’s license and barreling off in the family station wagon. There was also special meaning in 16 for the stock market Monday, as the most well-known “fear indicator,” the VIX, closed below that level for the first time since early November. A lower VIX, which in Monday’s case corresponded with both a S&P 500 (SPX) rally and the Fed’s recent more dovish stance, potentially might indicate less choppy action in the near future. It also could hint at investors maybe getting more willing to embrace cyclical sectors as fear retreats.While there’s no guarantee of this happening, the fall below 16 is a 180 from just over a month ago, when VIX rose above 36 during the Christmas Eve sell-off. That was the highest level since February of last year. VIX has fallen pretty steadily since Dec. 24, and is back near its historic average in the 15 handle.Often, but not always, a lower VIX can mean a less risk-averse investor mood. A market like December’s—when major indices seemed to go up or down (more often down) 2% every session—can have some investors looking for “risk-off” places to put their money. While there’s no “risk-free” investment, a high VIX means investors often tend to gravitate toward some of the bond-like sectors such as utilities, or simply pull money out of stocks and put it in fixed income or gold. Utilities and health care were among the leading sectors in December when VIX was soaring. Gold also rose sharply.Contrast that with Monday, when info tech easily topped the leaderboard with a 1.6% gain. Accompanying that were solid performances in other so-called “risk-on” sectors like industrials and communication services. Defense sector stocks and some of the “FAANGs,” including Netflix, performed particularly well. At the same time, health care and utilities were down near the bottom of the performance ladder.Some of the stocks that climbed Monday included ones that were beaten up the most last year amid higher fear levels, including Apple Inc. AAPL, Boeing Co BA, and Facebook, Inc. FB. Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT and Microsoft were also among the big gainers. People sometimes underrate how psychologically what AAPL means to the market. When its shares fell to 52-week lows, that appeared to cause some investors to decide it was time to come back into the market—and not just into AAPL. Some other beaten-down stocks that also exert influence (though maybe not to the same extent as AAPL) include General Electric and Ford Motor Company F.Figure 1: WHAT A DIFFERENCE A MONTH MAKES: The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) finished 2018 with a 25-handle, down a bit from the Christmas Eve stock market selloff, but quite a bit higher than where it finished Monday at 15.7. The term structure of the fear index has been altered as well. Note the shift in the futures (/VX) curve from the beginning of the year (yellow line) to Monday (red line) has gone from steep backwardation (near-term futures higher than deferred months) to contango, with lower prices in the near-term futures contracts. Data Source: CBOE Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  Revisiting FAANGs: Anyone who wrote off the FAANGs after last year’s swoon might be having second thoughts now as the five names (combined) are slightly outpacing the S&P 500 (SPX) year-to-date. FAANG names combined were up more than 9% in 2019 as the week began despite what might be best described as a mixed earnings season for the closely watched stocks. While investors seemed to greet Facebook and Apple earnings with elation, they didn’t appear so wild about what they heard from Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, GOOG, or Netflix, at least judging from how the stocks performed after company financial data hit the news. What remains to be seen is whether the FAANGs can start to recover some of the excitement that helped make them momentum drivers of the 2016-2018 market rally. The FAANG stock recovery early this year occurs as the overall market also appears to be in recovery mode, but what’s not so clear is whether FAANGs are simply rising as part of a tide that lifts all boats or if they’re in the vanguard. Considering the various issues that now divide the FAANGs—privacy, user growth, China trade, advertising demand—it could be difficult to see them trading once again as a solid block leading the market higher (or lower).Cool Beans?: Amid the wrangling over trade tensions with China, soybeans might be a key ingredient. Though China recently re-entered the U.S. soy market, agreeing to buy 5 million tons of the oilseed, it's still a drop in the bushel compared to its purchases in prior years. And according to Jim Collins, head of DowDupont Inc's DWDP agricultural division, farmers might still be unconvinced in the soybean's return to export prominence. Though many farmers are holding off in making final planting decisions, early signs still point to a downshift in soy plantings in favor of corn, and to perhaps a lesser degree wheat and cotton, Collins says. Agribusiness firms such as DWDP typically get a first-hand view as sales of fertilizer and seed, purchased at the start of the growing season, might offer clues into planting preferences.    Tech Talk: Looking for a moment at the technical underbelly of the market, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) has left the 50-day moving average far behind and for the first time in a while has the 200-day moving average back in sight. Last month, the index bounded past the 50-day average (now near 2609) and then faltered and tested it. That support appeared to hold, and the SPX is now above 2700 for the first time since early December. The 200-day moving average is a moving target, of course, and is down from where it stood back a month or two ago. As of Monday, it rested at 2741, just 17 points from where the SPX closed. While the 200-day moving average seemed to represent solid support for much of last year before the autumn sell-off, according to many Wall Street analysts, it could now form a resistance point. Sometimes—but not always—market momentum can pick up when a major index takes out some of the moving averages. The 100-day moving average of 2709 is another one investors might want to consider monitoring. Even if you don’t trade the technicals, getting familiar with these levels can sometimes help an investor better decipher the market’s behavior.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

JD.Inclusion of specific security names in this commentary does not constitute a recommendation from TD Ameritrade to buy, sell, or hold.Historical OverviewTD Ameritrade's Investor Movement Index (IMX) has generally correlated with the S&P 500 as clients react to equity price movements, but the index has gone through uncorrelated periods. Beginning in January 2010, when TD Ameritrade started tracking the IMX, the index rose with equity markets until April 2010, when it peaked at 5.40. In May 2010 investors experienced the ""Flash Crash"" and the IMX began a sharp downward trend. The IMX didn't reach 5.00 again until the S&P 500 was well above April 2010 levels. The index eventually peaked at 5.56 in June 2011. This peak was immediately followed by a plunge in equity markets, and in the IMX, as the media was dominated by the U.S. debt ceiling debate, S&P downgrade of U.S. debt, and European debt concerns. The S&P 500 began to recover in the fall of 2011, but the IMX continued to decline until it reached a new low at the time in January 2012. As the S&P 500 began to sustain an upward trend in early 2012, the IMX started to rise. In 2013, as economic conditions improved and the S&P 500 climbed to record levels, the IMX rose to the high end of its historical range, finishing 2013 at 5.62, and continued to rise in 2014 amid geopolitical tensions related to Ukraine and the Middle East, until seeing slight declines in October and November. By the middle of 2015 the IMX had seen increases, as equity market volatility had reduced to near historical levels while the market continued its upward trend. As 2015 ended its third quarter, volatility had returned to markets, as global economic concerns and speculation around the timing and trajectory of Federal Reserve rate increases seemed to rattle overall equity markets. This uncertainty continued to play a role in the equity markets through the fourth quarter of 2015 and into early 2016. The volatility accompanying this uncertainty abated in the second quarter of 2016 and remained low until late in the third quarter. Just as it had in 2015, the IMX saw increases mid-year during the period of lower volatility. The IMX continued to climb into the fourth quarter reaching 5.83 in October 2016, its highest point in two years. A brief spike in volatility during November, timed around the U.S. presidential election, coincided with a slight pull back in the IMX, which then ended 2016 at the high end of its historical range. The IMX started 2017 with an upward trend and reaching an all-time high in March, before pausing in April as lower volatility lead to a decrease in the IMX. The momentum resumed in May, with the IMX breaching 7.0 for the first time ever in July of 2017. The IMX took another brief pause in September, before following markets higher and breaching 8.0 for the first time ever in November and ending 2017 at an all-time high. Volatility returned to the markets in early 2018, and the IMX decreased for four consecutive months to start the year. The IMX then rebounded in the spring of 2018, and continued higher during the summer on the back of better-than-expected earnings and increasing equity markets.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

41,52,AAPL,January's Market Bounce Resulted In Some Unexpected Retail Trading Trends,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13104665,"Charting its fourth consecutive monthly drop, January’s edition of TD Ameritrade’s Investor Movement Index (IMX) reached a new nine-year low of 4.28, a 2.95-percent difference from the index’s December score of 4.41.The declining sentiment comes as the market continues to dig out from under the losses it sustained in the final, volatile months of 2018, gaining an impressive 7.73 percent over the course of January. Although TD Ameritrade clients were net buyers of equity overall, purchasing was light, which the brokerage attributes to a decrease in CBOE’s Volatility Index to near three-month lowsNew Lows Were A Buy Signal In Big NamesIf there was one lingering effect of the year-end sell-off, it was that high profile large- and mega-cap stocks were at a rare discount. Investors took advantage of this weakness by propelling several performance growth stocks to the top of their buy lists.Among these were Apple Inc. AAPL and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, which both entered January near 52-week lows. They finished the month in a stronger fashion, both reporting positive earnings surprises. While Amazon managed to retake its pre-December levels on the back of bottom-line numbers that far exceeded expectations, Apple still finished January more than 25 percent below its most recent high.However, not all of the big-equity net buys were performance stocks. Early-year bounces in less volatile names like Ford Motor Company F, General Electric Company GE and AT&T T, which all hit multi-year lows in December, prompted investors to take or add positions in these long-neglected stocks.See Also: TD Ameritrade's Investor Movement Index Highlights Grim Grinning Outlook For 2019Selling Off M&A And Social Media BacklashJanuary’s market-wide upswing also marked an opportunity for investors to lighten their portfolios of some of January’s early outperformers.Biotechnology companies Celgene Corporation CELG and Gilead Sciences Inc. GILD were both net sold in the month after it was announced at the start of the year the former was being acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. BMY, an announcement that caused prices to jump in stocks throughout the sector.On the other end of the selling spectrum, social media concerns Twitter Inc. TWTR and Facebook, Inc. FB were net sold through the month amid some extra volatility and continued negative press surrounding privacy and data breaches. This caused many investors take profit in the bullish market conditions.

42,53,AAPL,"Analysts View Skyworks Shares Positively Despite Apple, China Weaknesses",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13110973,"Apple Inc. AAPL supplier Skyworks Solutions Inc SWKS  reported  in-line first-quarter results and announced a $2-billion stock buyback program Tuesday. The AnalystsBMO Capital Market's Ambrish Srivastava maintained an Outperform rating on Skyworks and raised the price target from $85 to $94.Raymond James' Chris Caso reiterated a Market Perform rating.MKM Partners analyst Ruben Roy maintained a Buy rating and lifted the price target from $85 to $90.BMO: Skyworks Shares Have Attractive Risk-Reward Profile Skyworks'  March quarter guidance fell short, with mobile — which accounts for about 73 percent of revenue — expected to trail estimates even as the diversified broad markets demand remained strong, BMO's Srivastava said in a Wednesday note.The analyst sees the $2-billion share repurchase announced by the company as a big positive. The free cash flow and sales margin target of 30 percent seems sustainable, he said. BMO lowered its FY19 estimates, while it maintained its FY20 as well as CY20 estimates largely unchanged.The firm said it continues to like the stock.""An ability to sustain a high level of FCF-sales ratio, along with a higher commitment to capital allocation, at 60-75 percent, a number reset in the nearer term, tied together with an attractive valuation, make for an attractive risk-reward prospect for the shares,"" Srivastava said. Raymond James: Traction In 5G, New BAW Technology Are Key After the issuance of below-consensus March quarter revenue guidance, a further cut cannot be ruled out on the basis of a potential Apple decision to end the life of a model or just further sell-through weakness, Raymond James' Caso said. Yet the analyst sees this as a healthy cut, as expectations are appropriately reduced. As expected, weakness in China and at Apple weighed on December quarter results, and the March quarter guidance reflected weakness in iPhone and China, cushioned by cost control, the analyst said. ""The key in determining whether the stock is worth owning in the interim are their prospects in 5G and new BAW technology, something for which we will seek more clarity over the coming months."" MKM: 'We Continue To View Skyworks Shares Positively'Notwithstanding persistent near-term head winds to Skyworks' mobile business, the company is a longer-term beneficiary of increasing RF content across a diverse set of end market applications, MKM analyst Roy said in a note. The analyst said he expects revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of 2019, as ""new designs with increased dollar content ramp into production.""The company's profitability metrics will continue to outperform peers, Roy said. MKM said it continues to view Skyworks shares positively given their discounted valuation to the semiconductor peer group.The Price ActionSkyworks shares were surging 12.4 percent to $85.38 at the time of publication Wednesday. Related Links:JPMorgan Says Apple Should Go After Netflix, Sonos Or Activision KeyBanc Survey Shows 'Disappointing' iPhone Cycle Photo courtesy of Skyworks. ",2019-02-06
43,55,AAPL,"For Sale: Performance Stocks, Slightly Worn",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13122983,"In the shadow of a strong January and continued earnings strength, investors are seemingly shoring up defensive assets for leaner times ahead, at least based on data from TD Ameritrade’s monthly Investor Movement Index. Are these sales and purchases a temporary phenomenon, or a portent of things to come?The January edition of the survey, which tracks trading activity among TD Ameritrade clients, shows investors unloading typical performance names in favor of more steady value stocks.Despite sustaining heavy losses that put it at a two-year low prior to its most recent earnings report, Facebook, inc. FB was net sold in the month.Continued strong M&A activity didn’t keep the volatile biotech industry from going up for sale, with Gilead Sciences, Inc. GILD being sold nearly 14 percent below its most recent high.Raytheon Company RTN was met with a similar fate, selling at a minimum 18 percent coupon even though fellow contractor United Technologies Corporation UTX reported strong earnings results and solid 2019 guidance.Obviously, there were mitigating circumstances in all of these cases. Facebook’s troubles are well documented, and many investors may have taken the most recent privacy controversies as a key moment to lighten their holdings. As for Gilead and Raytheon, they were both higher on the month due to rising sentiment in their respective industries.Why Choose Value When Everything’s On Sale?In contrast to the stocks investors were unloading over January, those they added to their portfolios are many that have gone long neglected by most of Wall Street.Ford Motor Company F, General Electric Company GE and AT&T Inc. T, each of which was near multi-year lows, were among the most popular portfolio additions in the month. Alongside them were other slow-growth defensive names like consumer staples stock Altria Group Inc. MO and the heavily diversified Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-B).While the list of net buys aren’t entirely safety stocks, Apple Inc. AAPL and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN make appearances as well, they were both carrying discounts of anywhere from 10-35 percent during the month.In fact, the only net bought stock in the survey that was neither a defensive stock nor in correction territory through most of the month was Microsoft Inc. MSFT.Volatility Down, Earnings Up, Head On A SwivelSo what does all this mean in the context of January’s raw market numbers? The S&P 500 chart for the month might speak to the sheer strength of buying during January, but here are some facts to provide a little context for its unique characteristics:
The S&P 500 gained 9.5 percent over the course of the month, its strongest monthly performance since October 2011 and its best January since 1987
Volatility, which according to the VIX reached a three-year high in December, fell by nearly 30 percent in the month, settling back to its pre-October level
Fourth quarter earnings showed 66.7 percent of companies who reported by the start of February beat bottom-line estimates, while 62.8 percent beat on revenue expectations
While that last point might seem less staggering than the first two, it’s arguably the most important trend of the month. That’s because throughout both 2017 and 2018, at least 70 percent of S&P 500 companies uniformly beat their quarterly estimates by at least 70 percent. That trend seemingly peaked in Q3, which saw 80 percent of the S&P 500 surpass EPS expectations while 77 percent beat on their top-line results.Again, it’s important to consider the mitigating circumstances that might have contributed to the steep drop in earnings performance. For one, the financial and accounting benefits of the 2017 tax cuts have mostly worked their way through the market. Companies have largely exhausted their minimal plans for capital investment, instead of using the funny money primarily on a record amount of buyback programs.Then there’s the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, which ramped up to its current pitch mid-way through 2018. While the effects on domestic industries were largely isolated through 2018, the impact of strained relations between the world’s two largest economies could now finally be acting as a drag on the balance sheets of corporate America at large.Traders will have to wait and see whether these issues will prove to be harbingers of a true bear market. However, based on the data, it seems as though many investors aren’t taking chances.",2019-02-07

46,60,AAPL,"Samsung Reveals Foldable Smartphone, New S-Series Lineup: 'A Potential Problem For Apple'",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13219868,"With smartphone sales plateauing amid market saturation and increased adoption rates, manufacturers are vying for a piece of a shrinking market and relying on innovation as a differentiator. Both Apple Inc. AAPL — with its  iPhone fiasco — and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF had a  forgettable 2018. Samsung unveiling its latest lineup of Galaxy S10, S10+, S10e and S10 5G smartphones at its Unpacked event Wednesday in San Francisco. This also marked the tenth launch anniversary of the Galaxy S.Galaxy Fold: A Tablet-Phone HybridThe company also gave a sneak-peek at its Galaxy Fold phone. It doubles as a tablet, and upon unfolding, creates a 7.3-inch touchscreen.When unfolded, the Galaxy Fold can simultaneously run three different apps on the screen.The device's 7.3-inch Infinity Flex Display is a tablet-sized screen; when folded, it has a smaller 4.6-inch HD+ display.The specs include 512 GB Universal Flash Storage 3.0, a QUALCOMM, Inc. QCOM 7nm octa-core processor, 12GB of RAM and two batteries.The foldable phone will sport six cameras: three at the back, two on the side and one on the front. The phone falls in the ultra-premium segment, with a price tag of $1,980.The Galaxy Fold has a compelling form factor that only Samsung's OLED tech can deliver, said Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall, according to CNBC.""Should that form factor spark consumer interest, we would expect Samsung to delay access to the technology for Apple. We see this as a potential problem for Apple this year, though the lack of a device at this point drives us to reserve judgment.""The Fold launches in LTE and 5G versions beginning April 26.The Newest S-Series TrioThe S10, S10+ and S10e are available for pre-order Thursday and become commercially available March 8 with starting prices of $900, $1,000 and $750, respectively.All three phones  will have AMOLED screens, with 6.1-inch, 6.4-inch and 5.8-inch displays, respectively.

47,62,AAPL,"Warren Buffett Gives Thumbs-Up To New Execs, Notes Earnings Impact From Kraft Heinz In Annual Berkshire Hathaway Letter",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13232625,"The market value of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) grew by 2.8 percent in 2018 and the conglomerate earned $4 billion, outpacing the S&P 500 but down substantially from the prior year’s 21.9-percent growth. The Omaha, Nebraska company’s balance sheet at year’s end included a $3-billion non-cash loss largely caused by Berkshire’s stake of more than 325 million shares in Kraft Heinz Co KHC, CEO Warren Buffett said in his annual letter to shareholders Saturday.Kraft Heinz took a $15.4-billion writedown on Kraft and Oscar Mayer and announced both a dividend cut and SEC investigation when it released its fourth-quarter report Thursday. Berkshire’s annual meeting is Saturday, May 4 in Omaha. A Good Problem To Have: Berkshire's Cash Pile The 88-year-old CEO reiterated his wish to invest Berkshire’s year-end cash surplus of $112 billion in a company. “The immediate prospects for that, however, are not good: prices are sky-high for businesses possessing decent long-term prospects,” Buffett said. In 2019, Berkshire is likely to continue expanding its equity holdings, he said. “We continue, nevertheless, to hope for an elephant-sized acquisition.” The conglomerate maintains at least $20 billion in ""untouchable"" cash at all times, Buffett said. “Berkshire will forever remain a financial fortress. In managing, I will make expensive mistakes of commission and will also miss many opportunities, some of which should have been obvious to me,” he said. “At times, our stock will tumble as investors flee from equities. But I will never risk getting caught short of cash.”Top HoldingsBerkshire’s Kraft Heinz holding is carried on its balance sheet at a GAAP figure of $13.8 billion, a figure reduced by the food stock’s large write-off in 2018, Buffett said. The holding had a year-end market value of $14 billion and a cost basis of $9.8 billion, he said. As Benzinga reported Friday, Berkshire’s Kraft Heinz investment has been highly unsuccessful, losing more than half its value since it was first made in 2015. When the stock plunged by almost 28 percent Friday, the value of the shares dropped by billions more. Berkshire’s five largest equity investments are listed below by percentage stake at year’s end. The list excludes the company’s Kraft Heinz stake, which is held as part of a control group and recorded using a different accounting method. 
American Express Company AXP: 17.9 percent
Apple Inc. AAPL: 5.4 percent
Bank of America Corp BAC: 9.5 percent
The Coca-Cola Co KO: 9.4 percent
Wells Fargo & Co WFC: 9.8 percent 
Berkshire’s non-insurance holdings earned $20.8 billion in pre-tax income in 2018, 24 percent more than in 2017. Buffett pointed out that the after-tax figure is 47 percent, thanks to a cut in the corporate tax rate during the year from 35 to 21 percent. Younger Execs Take Over Operations In 2018Buffett is the more youthful occupant of Berkshire’s C-suite — Vice Chairman Charlie Munger is 95.In 2018, Ajit Jain and Greg Abel were elected as directors and Berkshire vice chairmen. Jain is responsible for the insurance business, while Abel oversees the rest. While Buffett did not directly address leadership succession in Saturday’s letter, he gave Jain and Abel his vote of confidence. “These moves were overdue,” Buffett said. “Berkshire is now far better managed than when I alone was supervising operations. Ajit and Greg have rare talents, and Berkshire blood flows through their veins.”An ‘Old Testament Style’ Insurance BusinessDescribing the property and casualty insurance business as the “engine propelling Berkshire’s growth since 1967,” Buffett said the segment posted a $2-billion underwriting profit in 2018. That’s in contrast to the segment’s $3.2-billion loss in 2017 due to $100 billion in hurricane-related insurance losses. The year was an exception to the rule for Berkshire, marking the only underwriting loss for the insurance division over a 16-year stretch. “That record is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of our insurance managers, who know that the benefits of float can be drowned by poor underwriting results,” the venerable CEO said. “All insurers give that message lip service. At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.”Related Links: Berkshire Hathaway's Share Buyback: What You Need To KnowBuffett's Berkshire Hathaway Finds One Place To Deploy Cash Horde: FintechBerkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett in 2015.

48,63,AAPL,"Soft Touch: Home Depot's Earnings Miss, Caterpillar Downgrade Both Appear To Weigh",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13246557,"The week began with tons of positive momentum, but that appears to be dissipating a bit Tuesday morning. Asian and European stocks are lower and crude is struggling a little after a major plunge yesterday. Meanwhile, geopolitical news continues to swirl, but without any major new developments on the China trade front, investors might find themselves grasping for catalysts.The day began with some disappointing news from Home Depot Inc HD, which missed analysts’ estimates on earnings and sales. Guidance also came in below the Street’s expectations, and shares fell about 2% in pre-market trading. The housing market, which HD and Lowe’s Companies, Inc. LOW are sometimes seen as barometers for, has been soft for a while due in part to rising mortgage rates. One school of thought suggested that companies like HD might be able to weather weak home sales because more people might decide to renovate instead and head to HD to buy building materials or new appliances. One earnings report isn’t a trend, but HD’s Q4 could raise some concerns and have people wondering if that thesis still works. LOW’s earnings are due tomorrow morning, so that might offer investors a better sense of whether HD’s Q4 miss was isolated or reflects any industry-wide issues.In another negative development early Tuesday, shares of industrial giant Caterpillar Inc CAT crumbled nearly 4% in pre-market trading after an analyst downgraded the company because of what it said could be slowing construction sales next year driven by falling demand around the world. Industrials have led the way for the broader market so far this year, so any sign of cracks in the foundation might have an outsized impact on investor sentiment. The downgrade also might play into fears of slowing world economies, which is a separate issue from the potential trade deal with China and might persist even if an agreement gets signed.Not all the corporate news was bad early Tuesday. Macy’s Inc. M shares got a bit of a lift after the department store beat analysts’ sales and earnings estimates. This came after the company told investors last month about its holiday season struggles. Same-store sales in the quarter rose a little more slowly than Wall Street had expected, but investors might be enthused about the company announcing a new restructuring plan Tuesday that it said in a press release could cut costs $100 million annually.VIX Pops Up After A Long SlideStocks pulled back Monday to finish well off their highs, and one interesting development was a big jump in volatility as measured by VIX. That’s a U-turn from the recent trend and might be worth a closer look. Fear has steadily ebbed over the last few weeks, but it looks like at least on Monday we saw what could be a giant hedge take shape as tariffs got kicked down the road. There was a large amount of volume in the VIX calls, with the April monthly 20, 23, 26, and 30 strikes all trading more than 100,000 contracts on the day. The cash VIX price rose nearly 10% to finish Monday just below 15 after dropping under 14 on Friday. (Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time).What can the average investor take away from this? It could just mean a few investors decided that VIX cash prices had become too low on an intraday basis and put hedges in place just in case there’s a bump in the road with Chinese trade talks later in the spring. If you look back a year to last February, many investors took a beating when they got caught in short VIX positions and the market turned on them. What we’re seeing now could be a little muscle memory at work.Slow Mo?Also, think back to last week, when the defensive Utilities sector started to see some strength and gold and the dollar stayed near recent highs. Though the geopolitical news has been good lately, there does seem to be a little caution in the market, and some of the momentum seen over the last nine weeks might be slowing down.The S&P 500 (SPX) is up more than 11% year-to-date, but the U.S. 10-year Treasury note yield is actually down a tick since the start of the year. Some veteran market watchers might see that as kind of odd, and it could partly reflect the Fed’s newfound dovishness. However, it could also be a sign of investors flocking to so-called “safe haven” trades (though no investment can truly be considered safe). Remember, European economies continue to struggle and bond yields in Germany are near zero, which could make U.S. Treasury bonds look attractive by comparison. While the stock market’s continued rally apparently reflects hopes for a trade deal, the strength in bonds might reflect fears of economic sluggishness. The question is whether this pattern of both higher stocks and Treasuries can continue. One arguably positive sign is that both the Dow Jones Transportation Average ($DJT) and the Russell 2000 Index (RUT) of small-cap stocks both continue to outpace the broader indices. Historically, strength in these two indices has sometimes been a sign of underlying stock market health and pointed toward more gains. However, past isn’t necessarily prologue. Meanwhile, the SPX’s forward price-to-earnings ratio of 16.2 is back to just under the five-year average, according to FactSet, after falling well under it at the end of last year. So anyone looking at stocks now would probably have to search a little harder to find potential “bargains.”Hungry For New Catalysts?If stock market momentum is slowing, it might go back to the appetite for new catalysts. The news on Monday around China sounded pretty similar to what we heard last week. Tariffs are going to be delayed, and that’s hard not to see as positive, but people might be getting tired of hearing the same thing and want more information.It’s also possible some investors might be getting worried about a “buy the rumor, sell the fact” trade setting up in the Industrial sector, which entered the week up 18% year-to-date amid optimism about trade talks. Industrials did continue to rise on Monday, however, and it was the more “defensive” sectors that ended up in the red.Speaking of sectors, it was encouraging to see financials and info tech as two of the top three sectors on the leaderboard Monday. History shows that strength in those two sectors can often be associated with market rallies, so it could be interesting to see if they continue to perform well. One source of info tech strength Monday came from the semiconductors, a sub-sector that some analysts think could possibly benefit from a trade deal. Apple Inc AAPL also had a decent day.When it comes to a trade deal, it’s important not to put the cart before the horse. Despite the recent progress, nothing is guaranteed, as President Trump himself said this week. Extension of the deadline appears to show, however, that U.S. and Chinese negotiators are working toward the goal of reaching a settlement that hopefully could help both economies grow. Markets are taking that as a very positive sign that fears of a slowdown due to tariffs could hopefully be mitigated.Words From WashingtonFocus might turn squarely toward the capital city today and tomorrow as Fed Chair Jerome Powell testifies to Congress. This is his chance to tell elected officials about the current state of the economy, and for them to ask him some questions. Powell’s been a Fed chair who tends to move the markets when he speaks, often negatively, so that might explain some of the uptick in volatility as well.The Fed has already publicly said it’s committed to pause here and watch the data come in, but many analysts and the Fed itself (judging from its December “dot plot”) still don’t rule out possible rate increases this year. Powell is likely to get asked about that, and about the Fed’s balance sheet plan. It seems unlikely that Powell would say much that people didn’t already see in last week’s Fed minutes, but you never know, so it could be important to stay tuned.On the data front, Q4 gross domestic product (GDP) Thursday is probably the key number to watch, along with today’s housing starts and consumer confidence. Another number to keep in mind comes Wednesday in the form of December factory orders. If the economy is truly slowing, this report could provide more evidence. Weakness in November business investment could potentially have translated into more softness in December, especially considering the weak stock market and government shutdown taking place then might have dragged on business confidence, Briefing.com said. However, the Briefing.com consensus is for a 1% month-over-month rise in the December headline number.From a technical perspective, Monday’s action in the SPX had to look a bit disappointing. The index climbed above 2800 for the first time in months intraday but couldn’t hold that level into the close and finished just below it. This kind of move could seem kind of bearish if you put much emphasis on support and resistance levels, and failure to pierce 2800 could potentially increase fears that the rally might be losing steam.Figure 1: VIX Ticks Up a Notch: It may not look like much on this three-month chart, but the VIX (candlestick) popped about 10% Monday in what appeared to be a possible sign of some investors starting to hedge volatility after long quiet period. The 200-day moving average for cash VIX is the blue line, and VIX recently fell below that level and has stayed there for several weeks. If that moving average gets challenged, it might be interesting to see if more buyers come in. Data Source: Cboe Group. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Nothing Too Taxing: As tax day approaches, it’s tempting to think most of the big changes might be behind us for now thanks to passage of the new tax law in late 2017. That doesn’t mean, however, there won’t potentially be some tinkering around the edges this year and maybe in years to come. One idea touted by some think tanks that might affect investors (if it ever becomes law) would allow taxpayers to reduce capital gains taxes by adjusting the initial value of an asset—like a home or a share of a stock— for inflation when it sells, The New York Times said. The thought behind this would be to free more money for investment, and some supporters of it have been meeting with the Trump administration, the newspaper noted. How much traction this idea ends up getting remains to be seen.  Other tax ideas being discussed include possibly extending some expired tax credits retroactively, such as deductions for private mortgage insurance and higher-education expenses.FAANGs Step Up to Plate: With baseball’s spring training well underway, it may be worth noting that the FAANGs hit a rare grand slam Friday as all five companies in this group ticked higher.  It would have been back-to-back on Monday except for losses in Alphabet Inc GOOG. However, MarketWatch pointed out last week that FAANGs aren’t totally out of their slump. Four of the five remain below their respective 200-day moving averages. The only exception is Netflix (NFLX). Also, most of the FAANGs are getting outpaced by the S&P 500 (SPX) so far this year. While it’s possible to put too much emphasis on technical indicators like the 200-day moving average, they sometimes can help investors get a sense of bullish sentiment. It’s arguably bullish if a stock finds buyers after punching through a key technical point like the 200-day. The FAANGs were where a lot of the bullish momentum was last year, but they haven’t really led so far in 2019. In addition, famous investor and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) CEO Warren Buffett said in an interview Monday that he’s not buying shares of FAANG member Apple at this time, though it remains a major holding.Insight From The “Oracle of Omaha”: Speaking of Buffett, he gave a wide-ranging interview yesterday on CNBC where he shared a lesson that might be useful for other long-term investors. Asked about Kraft Heinz Co KHC, which cratered last week after the company announced a $15.4 billion write-down, Buffett admitted BRK had overpaid for shares of KHC. However, he added he’s not selling. “We don’t pull the plug…” Buffett said. “It isn’t our style.” That doesn’t mean there’s never an appropriate time to give up on a stock, but if you still believe in a business—as Buffett apparently does in KHC judging from other comments he made in the interview—bad news and a major share drop don’t necessarily mean long-term investors should run for the exits. If a stock craters, it might be time to potentially reconsider why you own it in the first place and whether it still fits into your long-term plans. It’s also a chance to look more deeply into the company’s financials and its leadership to see if you still can find reasons to keep it in your portfolio or if you don’t believe in its future any longer. Fear tends to drive some investors into bad decision-making, so it’s important to allow cooler heads to prevail (including your own) before jumping to quick conclusions.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

49,64,AAPL,Headline Edge: Which Stocks Have Been Most Impacted By The US-China Trade War,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13267206,"With earnings season done, another government shutdown averted and the Federal Reserve signaling they plan on keeping interest rates steady for the time being, there’s only one lingering macroeconomic uncertainty hanging over the market heading into March, and that’s the U.S.-China Trade War.Although the broad market has reacted to even the slightest rumor emerging from negotiations between the two countries, certain stocks have felt the impact of these headlines more than others. Using AI computational linguistics to extract meaning and interpret sentiment on headlines, articles and other relevant publications, the Yewno|Edge stock research platform allows traders to see which companies hold the highest degree of exposure to these latest trade developments.The market received a boost in the most recent development in the trade spat from President Donald Trump’s Twitter, Inc. TWTR profile when he tweeted he plans on delaying a March 1 deadline on additional tariffs. However, with a true resolution to the conflict still uncertain, the market will likely see more volatility as negotiations between the world’s two largest economies continue into spring.With the help of Yewno|Edge, we’ll take a look at some of the stocks whose performance have been most heavily influenced by their proximity to news, rumors and chatter surrounding the U.S.-China trade war and the talks to resolve it.Between The HeadlinesFirst, let’s examine which companies have news related to the trade war and how that news is influencing investor sentiment, which we can find by doing a concept search for “Trade War” through Yewno|Edge’s Key Developments tool.A glance at the headlines following news of the tariff postponement shows that, despite the worries of slowing growth in China being exacerbated by the trade war, U.S. companies with exposure to China like Starbucks Corporation SBUX Walmart Inc. WMT and even Apple Inc. AAPL have reported healthy financial statistics and are still generally well-regarded by investors. Note the indicators to the right of each headline which show the stock impacted by the news as well as the degree to which sentiment is influencing them. The three headlines dealing with Starbucks, Apple and Walmart are each rated neutral to positive as far as their impact on those companies.Click here to read our review of Yewno|Edge.On the other hand, the headline regarding soybeans and agricultural importer/exporter Bunge Ltd BG has a decidedly negative connotation for the company. Since agricultural and mineral commodities remain under direct and substantial tariffs, companies with exposure to commodities like soybeans, pork and aluminum still appear to be a liability.We can dig into this relationship further by visiting the company information page on Bunge, shown below.Among the first elements to pop out from this page are the negative sentiment ratings on Bunge in the bottom left corner from two recent headlines. Neither one is directly related to U.S.-China trade relations, but both speak to pressures the company is facing within the commodity industry, the first being an agribusiness report with a negative mention of Bunge and the second being a recent downgrade to the stock from Zacks Equity Research.Based on that search, it would appear that Bunge is more exposed to trade headlines. But measuring it against three consumer stocks isn’t the best comparison. Let’s see how Bunge’s exposure compares with its peers.We can do that by using Yewno|Edge’s Strategy Builder tool to search for industries whose basic operations rely strongly on commodity demand.We can see that, despite the recent attention, Bunge’s headline exposure to China is relatively low when compared to companies dealing in mineral commodities like Glencore PLC ADR GLNCY, POSCO PKX and United States Steel Corp. X.While traders and investors are relieved by the deadline extension, it’s important to keep in mind that, although new tariffs aren’t as close on the horizon as they once appeared, there are still hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods being taxed by either country. Until real progress is made, or until a true resolution is reached, companies across the board will likely feel the pressure of the global trade war.Yewno is a content partner of Benzinga.

51,67,AAPL,Apple's Streaming Ambition Could Result In Disney CEO Iger Resigning From iPhone Maker's Board,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13309104,"As Apple Inc. AAPL continues to push its streaming video business, the company may be forced to part ways with board member and Walt Disney Co DIS CEO Bob Iger.What HappenedApple continues to look at ways to expand its business amid slower iPhone sales by scooping up shows and movies at festivals as well as creating its own video content, Bloomberg reported.If the company were to make an aggressive push into streaming video, it could pose a conflict of interest with Iger, whose Disney is months away from launching its own potential rival platform.Both Apple and Disney are likely actively examining the legal ramifications of their close relationship, John Coffee, director of the Center on Corporate Governance at Columbia Law School, told Bloomberg.Apple said in a recent regulatory filing it has ""arms-length commercial dealings"" with Disney, but as of now Iger doesn't have a ""material direct or indirect interest"" in the dealings.Why It's ImportantApple co-founder Steve Jobs was Disney's largest individual shareholder and sat on its board after selling Pixar.

52,68,AAPL,Market Remains Lackluster Amid Tepid Trade News,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13310031,"The trade winds seem to have subsided and the market sailed into the doldrums.With the news flow on a potential China-U.S. trade deal slowing to a trickle and the market apparently lacking a catalyst to move higher – or even much lower – stocks have been drifting down in recent sessions, but the selling hasn’t had much conviction behind it. European stocks were mixed overnight as investors across the pond also appeared to be awaiting news on the trade front as well as a rate decision from the European Central Bank tomorrow. In Asia, mainland Chinese stocks rose after Beijing announced stimulus measures Tuesday including infrastructure spending and tax cuts.Economies in Europe and China have shown signs of weakening, with the Asian nation on Tuesday announcing a growth target for 2019 below last year’s expansion. If China achieves this year’s target of between 6% and 6.5%—down from last year’s 6.6% growth—it would mark a new three-decade low for Chinese economic growth, which wouldn’t be a good sign for global growth as a whole. Still, not all would be lost, as many nations would be envious of a growth rate that fast. And it would still offer plenty of potential for buying goods from and making up a key part of supply chains for multinational companies.The news out of China added to a lackluster day for Wall Street on Tuesday, when the S&P 500 Index (SPX) backed farther away from the psychologically important 2800 technical level. Given that stocks are up so much this year, that level might be serving as an excuse for some profit taking.It could also be that investors may think a trade deal with China is priced into the market but they also don’t see any major reason for stocks to sell off. Perhaps they’re waiting for a catalyst in either direction. One might be provided on Friday, in the form of the jobs report. (See more on nonfarm payrolls below.)Trade News in Holding PatternOn the China-United States trade front, President Trump is pushing U.S. negotiators to get a deal done soon, hoping to boost the market, according to a Bloomberg report. But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Sinclair Broadcasting Group that a U.S.-China deal has to be perfect for President Trump to accept it. Still, the United States would keep working on hammering out a deal if it rejected one that wasn’t just right, he said. He also told a Des Moines, Iowa, television station that he thinks the two nations are “on the cusp” of a deal. Those comments arguably don’t change much in Wall Street’s assessment of where things stand economically between the world’s two largest economies. Optimism that the two sides can reach a deal and avert further damage to the global economy has been one major leg of support for stocks this year following deep declines late last year on worries that the trade war would crimp global growth. Sector, Corporate, Economic RundownIndustrials was the worst performing S&P 500 sector on Tuesday, led lower by a more than 4.7% drop in General Electric Company GE shares. The company’s chief executive officer said that the free cash flow of its industrial division will be negative this year. Other corporate news was more positive, at least in the retail space. Target Corporation's TGT shares rose nearly 4.6%, helped by news that Q4 same-store sales as well as full-year guidance exceeded analysts’ expectations. Earnings and revenue for Q4 were in line to slightly higher than analysts had expected. Meanwhile, Kohl’s Corporation KSS shares closed more than 7.3% higher after the company handily beat analysts’ estimates on its top and bottom lines, and holiday same-store sales also rose faster than Wall Street had expected. In economic news, even as the Trump administration has been working toward a deal with China on tariffs to reduce a deficit, the trade deficit soared to a 10-year high in 2018 with an increase to $59.8 billion in December, according to a U.S. Commerce Department report released this morning, delayed due to the government shutdown. Economists expected closer to $57.3 billion, according to a Reuters survey. December’s deficit was a result of imports increasing 2.1% as exports declined 1.9%.  Separately, U.S. private-sector job growth appeared to slow in February. ADP figures this morning showed 183,000 new jobs were added in the U.S., versus a revised 300,000 jobs in January and an expected gain of 180,000. Retail and travel saw the greatest slowdown, according to ADP. That’s the lowest number of new private sector jobs since November.Investors are scheduled to see the release of the Fed’s Beige Book this afternoon. The central bank’s pivot to a more-dovish stance this year has been the other major leg of support for the market in the first two months of 2019.Looking Ahead to Payrolls: Although it remains to be seen whether recent S&P 500 down sessions are forming a top, it is arguable that investors are looking for a catalyst to push the market one way or another. One potential event could be the jobs report later in the week. Nonfarm payrolls for February are expected to show a gain of 173,000, according to a Briefing.com consensus estimate. If we see unexpectedly large gains like we have in recent reports, perhaps that could be a positive catalyst. This time around, it’s arguable that the market might not worry too much about the inflationary potential of such a report (unless there are outsized gains in average hourly earnings) given that inflation indications have been muted enough recently that the Fed has been able to step back into a more dovish stance. Instead, the market might view a better-than-expected jobs report as moving the economy back toward a Goldilocks scenario. Of course, GDP isn’t where it was in the first half of last year, but it’s still nothing to sneeze at. If the jobs report comes in soft, however, the market might react negatively as it would come during a time when we’re also seeing weak economic signals out of China and Europe. A Good Omen?: February was a historically unusual month for stocks. Since World War II, February has tended to be the second-worst performing month on average for S&P 500 stocks behind September, according to investment research firm CFRA. But this year, the benchmark rose 3% in February. What’s more, there have only been 28 times from 1945 through 2017 when the S&P 500 has risen in both January and February, as it has this year. For all of those occurrences, the SPX recorded an average 24% return for the whole year. “With equities on a tear so early in 2019, it should come as no surprise that cyclical sectors and momentum groups have outperformed the overall market,” CFRA noted. Millennials Buy Pot Stocks: Millennial investors make up an important part of the overall investor mix. And for the first time in four months, activity among TD Ameritrade’s millennial clients in equities differed from the total client population, according to February’s Investor Movement Index® (IMXSM), which is TD Ameritrade’s proprietary, behavior-based index that measures what investors actually have been doing and how they have been positioned in the markets. Overall, TD Ameritrade clients were net sellers of equities, but it turns out that millennials were net buyers of stocks. The younger generation bought Apple Inc. AAPL and pot stocks like Aurora Cannabis Inc ACB, Canopy Growth Corp CGC and Cronos Group Inc CRON.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

53,70,AAPL,"Boeing Dragging Down DJIA, But Signs Of Positive Action Elsewhere On Data, China",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13334759,"If there was ever a morning to illustrate the outsized impact one stock can have on the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI), this is it.The new week is off to a very turbulent start for Boeing Co BA, whose shares fell more than 9% in pre-market trading after the crash of one of the company’s planes in Africa over the weekend. Several countries have now grounded the airliner. Since BA is one of the 30 stocks in the $DJI and a high-priced one, it’s causing an outsized impact with such a big drop. The $DJI was down 150 points ahead of the opening bell.This shows what we’ve often said about the $DJI not being the best indicator of the overall market, especially when you look at the S&P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq (COMP) and notice both of them were higher in pre-market trading. That’s because aside from BA, there’s not a lot of negativity to start the week. Asian stocks bounced back from Friday’s losses after a Chinese government official hinted at progress in trade talks, and Apple Inc. AAPL shares got a boost in part from an analyst upgrade.Fed Chair Jerome Powell appeared on 60 Minutes last night and repeated what’s becoming kind of a Fed mantra about being patient and watching the data. Not surprisingly, he didn’t specifically discuss interest rates in the interview, but did repeat what he said recently to Congress about seeing signs of slowing global growth.There was also some better news early Monday on retail sales, which climbed 0.2% in January after a dramatic drop in December. This could have people a little less worried about consumer spending. Analysts had expected January retail sales to fall slightly.A Week To ForgetFear came from all corners of the globe last week as U.S. indices fell each day. Lower growth projections out of Europe, soft export data from China, lack of progress on the U.S./China trade front, and last but not least, a surprisingly sluggish U.S. February jobs report, combined to make last week the worst of the year for U.S. stocks.The stats don’t look too pretty. It was the first time all the major U.S. indices declined each day of a week since Oct. 31-Nov. 4, 2016, right before that year’s U.S. Presidential election, Dow Jones Newswires reported. The Dow Jones Transportation Average ($DJT) finished Friday on an 11-day losing streak, its longest stretch in the red since May 1972.Technically, things don’t look that healthy, either. The S&P 500 (SPX) hit what many analysts saw as resistance right near 2815 a week ago, and quickly fell back below 2800. After that, the index descended beneath the 200-day moving average of just over 2750, finishing the week on the wrong side of that key technical support point. The only saving grace might be a late-day revival Friday from session lows that kept the day from being a total washout. Still, the SPX fell about 2% for the week, and the Nasdaq (COMP) did slightly worse.Friday’s focus was on the February U.S. jobs report (see more below), which at 20,000 new positions came in way under Wall Street’s expectations for gains of around 180,000. It’s never a good idea to look at one report in isolation, and the same goes for this one. Three-month average jobs gains are right around 186,000, which is pretty good, but the volatility of the numbers is keeping investors on their toes. It’s possible the government shutdown affected the data, so what we really need to see is a full month of numbers not affected by that situation.All that aside, there’s no way to ignore what looks like a slowing jobs market, at least for the month of February. Many analysts saw the data as more evidence of weakening U.S. economic growth, and the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow indicator for Q1 gross domestic product (GDP) is now at just 0.5%. That compares with the government’s estimate of 2.6% for Q4 growth.China Tariffs Still Center Stage, But Brexit Also In FocusGoing into the new week, China tariffs remain front and center.  Whatever else might go on, that’s the story most likely to have a big impact.Last week’s news that there’s no date yet for a presidential summit likely contributed to Friday’s early weakness, along with the U.S. ambassador saying a deal isn’t as close as many people thought. The market ran out of positive catalysts last week on the geopolitical side, and probably won’t get much traction without progress on the China front. The Wall Street Journal reported late Friday that a signing ceremony for the U.S. and Chinese presidents could be pushed back into early April. The talk a week ago was late March. Word now, according to the paper, is that China wants a firm deal in hand before any presidential meeting. Early Monday, The Wall Street Journal had a more optimistic report in which it said China’s top banker signaled that the two countries are getting closer to a deal on the currency aspects of an agreement.Remember, until negotiations conclude, U.S. companies really don’t have a roadmap for trade, and that appears to be affecting many of their capital expenditure plans. It’s getting close to Q1 earnings season and many analysts expect year-over-year losses for S&P 500 earnings. If there’s no resolution on trade heading into the next round of earnings, that means investors might not be able to glean much information from CEOs and other executives of future spending plans. That’s especially true for the big multinational firms with major business operations in Asia. This week also brings more Brexit news, putting that uncertainty into the headlines again as the March 29 deadline approaches for Britain to make a deal with the European Union. Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement is up for a vote Tuesday, and she warned last week that no one knows what will happen if the vote fails. Markets don’t tend to like uncertainty, and that sort of talk is the very essence of uncertainty. Shakiness in Europe, where the European Central Bank pulled down its 2019 growth estimate to just 1.1% last week from the previous 1.7%, could potentially have an impact on U.S. Treasury note yields if investors start trying to find shelter from the Brexit winds and yield that’s better than the negligible rates offered in Europe. The German bund yield is down about 13 basis points from its March peak, recently trading just above 0.06%. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, which stayed pretty steady during the two-month stock rally of January and February, finished the old week near 2.63%.Dollar Starting To Show MuscleInvestors might want to consider watching the dollar index this week. It closed a little lower on Friday but remained above 97. It’s not at extremely high levels yet, but weakness in overseas economies seems to be giving it a lift lately, and that isn’t necessarily good news for multinational U.S. companies going into earnings season next month. The dollar might also get a boost if there are any signs of stumbles in the talks between China and the U.S., because the dollar is often seen as a place to go when there’s more risk in the picture.Sector-wise, Energy was the big loser on Friday, hurt in part by weakness in Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM after an analyst downgrade of the company. Food and gold companies, on the other hand, had pretty solid sessions. Industrials, Health Care, and Consumer Discretionary all fell Friday.Earnings this coming week are a little sparse, but computer tech company Oracle Corporation ORCL is expected to report after the close Thursday, perhaps offering investors a fresh look at the cloud space. Look for a preview of ORCL’s earnings on Ticker Tape later this week.There’s also a full helping of economic data ahead, starting with U.S. retail sales for January today. This report could get more attention than usual after the surprisingly soft December figure, but keep in mind that the government shutdown  might have caused more weakness in the January data.Other data to consider watching include consumer and producer price index reports for February due Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively, as well as durable orders and construction spending for January.While there’s a lot of uncertainty and we’re coming off the worst week of the year, it’s also important to try and keep things in perspective. The SPX is still up 9% year-to-date, and that doesn’t sound too bad if you consider the mood back around Christmas. Also, volatility appears to remain in check with the VIX sitting at just above 16 to end the week. That’s not far from the historical average and way down from the holiday peaks above 30. A mild VIX could suggest that many investors aren’t necessarily expecting a major washout, though there’s no way to ever be sure of that.Speaking of washout, Saturday marked the 10th anniversary of the March 2009 low for stocks reached during that year’s market crash, and the birthday of the long bull market we’re still in. It’s pretty incredible to think that 10 years ago we hit the closing low under 680 in the SPX, and are up more than 300% since then. The biggest thing most people have probably learned from that experience is that we don’t go straight up.Under the Line! After a rough time last week, the S&P 500 Index (candlestick) begins Monday just below its 200-day moving average (blue line), which has been an important support and resistance point. Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. No Panic Button On Jobs: First, let’s acknowledge that there’s no way around a sluggish February jobs growth number of 20,000, no matter how you slice it. Job growth is slowing, no doubt about that. However, there are a number of reasons not to read too much into one report. First, there’s been a lot of volatility recently in the payrolls data, and that may be related to the government shutdown and recent extreme weather in the Midwest. Also, job weakness was concentrated in the construction and hospitality sectors, which are very dependent on the weather. That likely contributed to this number being screwy. Also consider keeping in mind that the government actually raised the figures for December and January jobs growth, both of which came in very strong. So what we saw in February may have been a bit of an anomaly, and it arguably makes the March report more important in case of any major revisions to the February number or in case some of February’s jobs growth gets pulled into the March report. A Few More Job Takeaways: The last two times monthly payrolls reports came in way below estimates and below trend, in September 2017 and September 2018, the next month showed a big recovery. That doesn’t mean it will happen again, but it’s something to ponder. Also, other parts of the report, including wage growth of 3.4% and the unemployment rate of 3.8%, were both very strong and might help raise hopes for more consumer spending. Last year, numbers like that might have had some investors worried about possible Fed response, but the Fed doesn’t appear to be a factor anytime soon. Inflation has been benign for months, so it’s looking like the Fed might be right when it says wage growth won’t necessarily pump up prices. One more note: A widely watched metric, the U6 unemployment rate—which accounts for unemployed and underemployed workers who choose part-time work for economic reasons—was 7.3% in February vs. 8.1% in January. Housing Chatter: December new home sales released last week might deserve a closer look for some insights into the economy. Though average and median new home sales prices fell year-over-year in December, some housing analysts are focusing more on the month-to-month figures, which showed median and average sales prices climbing from November to December. The median price rose a solid 5% in December from the previous month, to $318,600. That might underscore a home market which appears relatively strong on the high end—with builders demanding (and receiving) higher prices during December even as a government shutdown loomed and the stock market cratered. The high-end consumer seems to be doing pretty well, judging from sales of expensive items like new homes and earnings results from high-end retailers. It’s the lower-income segments that seem to be facing more of a struggle. Need more insight into new home sales? It’s coming right up, as the government will release January new home sales on Thursday. The reports are bunched together because of a delay caused by the government shutdown.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

54,72,AAPL,"Brexit Time Again: As Parliament Votes, U.S. Stocks Have Mixed Tone With Boeing Down",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13343571,"Brexit is back in the news today, with a key parliamentary vote scheduled as the March 29 deadline looms. If you remember, the last time Parliament voted on a Brexit plan, back in January, it got overwhelmingly rejected. Since then, Prime Minister Theresa May has made changes. Earlier this week, May announced that the European Union had agreed to those changes, and now U.K. lawmakers get another crack at it. The vote is scheduled for Tuesday evening, meaning the heart of the U.S. trading day. It’s unclear how things will go, but media reports say it could be close.It looks like Monday’s impressive rally might ease a little today, but it did spill over into European and Asian markets amid hopes for progress on Brexit. Also, crude prices snapped right back from weakness late last week and are back above $57 a barrel. Crude’s performance remains a pretty good way to measure economic demand. Boeing Co BA lost more ground in pre-market trading as investigations into the weekend crash continue. This means the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) could again find itself under pressure from BA, perhaps diverging from larger indices.Heavy Data Load UnderwayThis week is a big one for data, starting with yesterday’s pretty decent retail sales for January that helped spark Monday’s gains. It probably came as a bit of a relief to see that number rise 0.2% after falling a revised 1.6% in December. It looks like the December slide might have been shutdown and market sell-off related. Also, probing a bit further into the January data, the core number rose a solid 1.1%, which Briefing.com said could cause some analysts to upgrade their quarterly growth expectations.Today and tomorrow, the big numbers to consider watching are the consumer price index and producer price index (CPI and PPI) for February. Something to remember about both is that the month brought some really bad weather to much of the Midwest and Northeast, so if any numbers come in short that could be the primary reason. Perhaps there just wasn’t the demand. Weather does go into it. When you look back at the jobs report for February, the areas that saw the biggest hiring declines were construction and leisure, both of which also sometimes depend on weather. Inflation might come up short for exactly the same reasons.The first number (CPI) came in this morning. It rose 0.2% in February, in line with expectations and up from flat in January. Core CPI moved up 0.1%, a bit below expectations and down from 0.3% a month earlier. At first glance, nothing in the numbers looks too surprising or market-moving. Consensus for PPI stands at 0.2%, according to Briefing.com.The week’s other big data are durable goods on Wednesday and January new homes on Thursday. For those thinking we just had new home sales last week, we did, but those were December’s. The government shutdown delayed some of the data, so now the reports are all bunched together. University of Michigan preliminary March sentiment early Friday is another possible economic barometer on the way later this week.Transports Reverse Course After 11-consecutive lower sessions, the Dow Jones Transportation Average ($DJT) made a U-turn Monday to rise nearly 2%. The 11-day skid was its longest since 1972, and might have raised some eyebrows among market veterans who see transports as a barometer of economic demand. Airlines, railroads, and package delivery companies climbed almost across the board, perhaps a sign of pent-up demand after the long drought.Small-caps, another sector under the weather lately, also rebounded Monday. This sector, like transports, is sometimes seen as an economic barometer. Speaking of barometers, most of last year saw so-called “FAANG” stocks provide momentum to the long rally that carried U.S. stock indices to all times highs by September. The FAANGs, like most other popular stocks, had to go sit in the corner in Q4 and plunged into correction territory. That’s long behind, and Monday’s performance—particularly in shares of Apple Inc. AAPL and Facebook, Inc. FB—hinted that the FAANGs might have the potential to once again be momentum leaders.AAPL got a lift when a major bank upgraded its stock. FB shares, which are up almost 40% from their Christmas Eve low, seem to be responding to a growing perception that the company might have put at least some of the privacy concerns behind it. FB also appears to be doing a good job of taking down so-called “fake news” from its platform. The main concern last year for FB was possible government action on the privacy issue. That hasn’t necessarily gone away, but the company appears to be doing what it can to get back into investors’ good graces.Talking Psychology as FAANGs Get Back in SwingTypically, it’s not a good idea to get into the “psychology” of the market. Experienced investors tend to focus on the raw numbers and what executives have to say about their business plans, as well as the global economy and central banks. Still, Monday’s action did seem to have a little psychology at work. Why? Because of AAPL and FB’s performance and how the rest of the market seemed to respond. To many investors, it appears that when the world is right with AAPL and FB, the world is right in general. That’s certainly arguable, and might not always be the case, but it appeared to drive much of Monday’s enthusiasm.It wasn’t just FAANGs lifting Info Tech on a day when the sector rose more than 2% to lead all the S&P 500 sectors. Over in the semiconductor space, shares of Nvidia Corporation NVDA took off Monday, rising 7% after the chipmaker said it would buy Mellanox Technologies, Inc. MLNX, a maker of Ethernet switches and adapters that connect computers to each other. This is a move analysts said could give NVDA a foothold in the competitive cloud space. Other chip company shares also gained some ground to start the week.One challenge the market had last year was seeing so much of the positive momentum bottled up in just the five FAANG stocks. Once they started to go south, everything else lost ground, too. If the entire Info Tech sector could start to hum and we see more days like Monday, that might be a positive sign for the overall market.Technically, things look pretty positive, too, as the week’s second day gets underway. The S&P 500 Index (SPX) climbed solidly back above its 200-day moving average of 2751 on Monday, and now isn’t too far from the recent highs above 2800 reached earlier this month before last week’s slump. The 2816 level looks like it might be the one to consider keeping an eye on, because that’s right where things turned around a week ago. Some analysts think the market might bounce back and forth in a relatively narrow range between last week’s lows and highs until there’s more clarity around the China trade situation.Investors might not want to lose track of the dollar index this week, either. It’s down from last week’s highs but still above 97. Slowing Chinese and European economies have the tendency to pull more investor money into the greenback, and that can hurt U.S. multinationals. If today’s Brexit vote fails, that could pressure the pound and put more strength into the dollar, too. At last glance, the dollar was gaining vs. the pound after legal questions arose about Prime Minister May’s deal.Neck and Neck Tech: Both the FAANGs (candlestick) and semiconductors (blue line) are off to strong starts this year, with both outpacing the S&P 500 Index (SPX) so far. Data Source: Nasdaq Global Indexes, NYSE.  Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Can Oracle Provide Insight?: It’s not a big week for earnings, but Oracle Corporation ORCL is scheduled to release its fiscal Q3 numbers after the close Thursday. As a company with a huge worldwide tech presence, ORCL’s earnings and call might offer investors another chance to see how big companies are doing as the European economy continues to stagnate and Asia slows. ORCL also provides a chance for investors to get a fresh look at the cloud computing space, where ORCL is a major presence but where competition continues to mount. Look for an ORCL earnings preview article here on Ticker on Thursday morning.Flight Risk: After last weekend’s tragic airplane crash in Ethiopia, a number of airlines grounded Boeing’s 737 Max 8 aircraft, and shares of BA slid nearly 6%. Two of these planes have gone down over the last year, though so far no one has determined if the crashes are related and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Monday it considers the planes airworthy. For market veterans, this might bring back memories of 1979 when a DC-10 crashed in Chicago, raising concerns about that aircraft. BA shares fell again in pre-market trading Tuesday as analysts noted that a worst-case scenario could cost the company billions of dollars.This does serve as a reminder that investors in stocks like airlines and airplane makers do face some risk, however minor, of these sorts of events. Any incident has the potential to immediately take prices down, as many investors tend to leap before looking at times like these. The better way might be to keep a close eye on things and wait for the full story to be evident before taking action. It’s never a good idea to let fear be your guide.Could Cheap Credit Grease Loan Business?: Despite Monday’s U.S. stock rally and some positive comments on the economy from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, there wasn’t a lot of movement in U.S. Treasury note prices early this week. The 10-year yield remained near recent low levels under 2.65%, though some analysts say it’s unlikely the yield could fall under 2.6% anytime soon unless global growth weakens further. Persistent low yields—which some analysts blame on a slowing global economy—haven’t been particularly great news for the Financial sector, in part because banks tend to make more money when they can issue loans with higher rates. Financials fell nearly 2.7% last week, and trail the SPX’s gains so far this year. However, there may be a silver lining. Yields at these levels, which are down from above 3.2% late last summer, could raise demand for loans and give banks more business. That might be something to check next month when the major banks report Q1 earnings and executives discuss their business environment.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

55,73,AAPL,China Might Take Some Starch Out of U.S. Rally With More Weak Economic Data,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13360307,"After hitting a five-month high in a broad-based rally on Wednesday, U.S. stock indices appear to take on a relatively neutral tone early Thursday as investors examined some weak Chinese data and assessed trade talk progress.Bloomberg reported that a summit between President Trump and Chinese President Xi is likely to get pushed back from March to April, raising questions about progress of the trade negotiations. This could potentially be a challenge as the day continues, but the mood seems to remain mostly positive after the S&P 500 Index (SPX) hit a five-month intraday high yesterday.China’s industrial output rose 5.3% in January and February, the slowest rate in 17 years. Although the country’s retail sales report, also out Thursday, beat analyst expectations, the industrial output data was the latest in a string of data suggesting a slowdown in the Chinese economy. If this news has any effect on U.S. stocks, some of the more China-sensitive sectors in the U.S. market including Industrials and Info Tech might be worth watching.S&P 500 Posts New 2019 High Wednesday Amid Broad GainsThe beat went on Wednesday, with U.S. stock indices pushing through key technical resistance as the Info Tech, Energy, and Health Care sectors helped lead the way. Industrials, which got battered around earlier this week due in part to the Boeing Co BA controversy (see more below), also had a good session. Even BA shares moved a little higher despite the U.S. government joining most other major countries in grounding the company’s 737 Max 8 airliner.What happened Wednesday looked like a continuation of Tuesday, with the S&P 500 Index (SPX) registering its highest close so far this year and its best closing level since last Nov. 7. The intraday peak above 2820 was the first time above that level in five months.Technically, investors received a bullish signal Wednesday from the SPX when it closed above 2800 for the first time in over a week. An earlier test of that level failed, helping set off a period of softness before the rally resumed Monday. The next technical level to consider watching is an area between 2831 and 2834 that the market’s had a bit of trouble with in the past. There was a really important bullet point from January durable orders, which rose 0.4% and continued a string of positive reports on that front. The data appeared to reinforce a message that’s worth repeating: We continue to get numbers that show the health of the consumer, and consumer health continues to drive the economy. That’s what this week has arguably shown us so far. Mortgage applications also looked solid, and producer prices for February showed no sign of any worrisome inflation. New home sales for January are due later this morning, and Oracle Corporation ORCL reports after the close.Last Friday, there was a lot of hand wringing about a “terrible” February jobs report. No argument, because it was terrible. However, it was bad for a lot of reasons, not all of which were necessarily about jobs. Weather and the government shutdown both seemed to have an impact, so now it looks like many investors are writing it off and waiting for next month’s payrolls data. Remember, one month is not a trend, and job gains are averaging 186,000 over the last three months even with February’s weakness included.Boeing Concerns Could Spread Beyond One CompanyOne thing to watch is the Boeing effect. It hardly needs to be said that BA is one of the biggest U.S. companies, and when President Trump announced the grounding at midday the markets sold off a bit. Also, VIX—the most popular market “fear index”—popped up pretty quickly to nearly 14 before easing back to below 13.5 by the closing bell. Bonds also came back a bit, possibly a sign of investor caution. Still 10-year yields, which move opposite of the underlying Treasury note, climbed a little on Wednesday and stayed above 2.6%.Credit card companies continued their strong move, and might be considered a momentum area the way they’ve been going lately. FAANGs all finished higher, led by Netflix, Inc. NFLX and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN. Semiconductors mostly stayed hot as well, led by surging shares of Nvidia Corporation NVDA.While there hasn’t been much news this week on the China trade front, the performance of the FAANGs, crude oil (which is now at four-month highs), and semiconductors all could hint at investor optimism about the negotiations. Some of the Consumer Staple and Consumer Discretionary stocks, which are a little less connected to any developments with China, also continue to climb. Both PepsiCo, Inc. PEP and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG hit 52-week highs Wednesday. What’s great about this market is it seems like every day we find a different area of the market leading things higher. When people ask if the rally has upside, that’s the kind of thing to consider pointing to. Unlike last year, when the market’s overall day could often be guessed at just by checking how the FAANGs did, this rally seems to have broader participation. For instance, even a defensive area, Utilities, is doing well, though it’s lagging the SPX slightly year-to-date. It stands to reason that bond proxies like Utilities and Real Estate would be performing better considering the weakness in Treasury yields that can sometimes cause investors to consider higher-yielding stocks.Will Investors Get a Brexit Rest?Overseas, concerns about Brexit—which ticked up Tuesday with Parliament’s rejection of U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May’s recent deal with the European Union—were a little more subdued Wednesday as Parliament voted against an “no-deal” Brexit. This vote was symbolic and not legally binding, The Washington Post reported. Another vote is scheduled today to postpone the March 29 Brexit deadline, but some analysts aren’t sure what the U.K. could accomplish with a delay, and it’s unclear if the European Union will negotiate any further beyond what it agreed to that already got rejected by Parliament. May has suggested waiting until June, after European elections. However, the European Union would have to approve any postponement.The long and short of it seems to be that investors will have to live with Brexit uncertainty a little bit longer, but at least it seems less likely that the U.K. would be allowed to float out to sea on its own on March 29, at least as long as the E.U. allows that date to be pushed back. If that happens, maybe Brexit could retreat into the background for a few weeks. Still, it never does seem to really go away.New Five-Month High For SPX: This six-month chart shows the S&P 500 (candlestick) charging ahead to a new five-month intraday high Wednesday and its best close since early November. The purple line tracks the dollar index, which is down a bit this week but remains elevated and hasn’t really been able to check the SPX’s progress so far this year.

Past performance does not guarantee future results. History Lesson?: As Boeing wrestles with safety questions about its 737 Max 8 airliner, it’s interesting to note that Chipotle posted a new 52-week high this week. Although burritos and aircraft are about as different as products can be, the two companies do have something in common. Both have had their product safety questioned and saw their stocks fall sharply amid the controversy. For CMG, it started back in 2015 when an E. Coli scare caused its once high-flying stock to crater from $758 in August 2015 all the way down to $247 in February 2018. This week, CMG shares traded at $639. What changed? Well, for one, the company seems to be past its safety concerns and attracting new customers even as it raises prices. Same-store sales rose 6.1% in Q4. That was after a 23.6% decline between early 2016 and early 2017. Is there a lesson here for BA investors? It’s way too early to know how things will shape out for BA or how long it might take. Even though no one has proved any link between BA and the latest incident, the stock is down 16% from the 2019 high it posted less than two weeks ago. This partly reflects fear that groundings of the aircraft—which accounts for about one-third of BA’s profit—could hit the bottom line. If investigators find nothing wrong with the 737 Max 8, investors might quickly relax. CMG’s experience shows that some companies are able to storm back after safety worries come up.The “What If?” Department: So the U.S. and Canada both grounded Boeing’s 737 Max 8 on Wednesday, leading investors to start wondering what the ramifications might be beyond BA itself. Basically, the question is whether BA can damage sentiment around not only its industry, but in related industries and the market in general. You can’t necessarily rule that scenario out. Sometimes BA is thought of as kind of a “derivative” for transportation in general. It’s the gorilla of the industry, and when the gorilla is in trouble, it sometimes brings down others. There’s also some worries about the market psychology, because BA is so heavily weighted in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI). The average person on the street who doesn’t necessarily follow stocks closely might see the Dow falling and get afraid. It depends on how things play out, but you might see people start canceling flights, too. So watch airline, hotel, and car rental stocks. If there’s a problem, those are the next stocks that could get hit.FAANGs On a Roll: It’s been a strong week for the FAANG stocks, which were up a combined 4.4% by midday Wednesday. This follows a 1% drop last week for the five FAANG names. Cumulatively, the FAANGs are up 26% since the Dec. 24 low to outpace the S&P 500’s (SPX) 19% gain since then, but still haven’t made it all the way back to their late summer highs. Also, though all the FAANGs were up Wednesday, they haven’t acted as one solid block. Netflix, for instance, has been the greenest of the group lately, up nearly 35% so far this year. Apple Inc AAPL, which got off to a slower start than some of its cousins in 2019, is up 15% year-to-date but made up some ground lately after getting slammed in early January for cutting its revenue outlook. Troubles might not be over for AAPL. On Wednesday, Barron’s quoted two research notes observing soft demand for the company’s products in China. Hopes for a trade deal might be helping AAPL shares lately, but even if an agreement is made, there’s no question that the economy there is slowing. That might be an issue for all the FAANGs, but some more than others (AAPL, for instance).Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

56,74,AAPL,Global Barometer: Oracle Earnings Could Provide Insight On Economy,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13360722,"Anyone seeking insight into the global economic picture might want to pay attention Thursday after the U.S. closing bell when computer technology corporation Oracle Corporation ORCL delivers its fiscal Q3 earnings. A big thing to consider looking for from ORCL is the company’s statement. We’re seeing worldwide economic growth slowing, and when it comes to “worldwide,” ORCL is probably as big as it gets. The question is what their projections might look like. Do they see slowing in Asia? Do they see continued weakness in Europe? The company is arguably a great barometer of how the world economy is doing.As of mid-March, ORCL shares were up 14% year to date, compared with about an 11% rise for the S&P 500 Index (SPX). In the past 52 weeks, the stock has been roughly flat. ORCL is expected to report earnings per share of $0.84, from $0.83 in the prior-year period, on revenue of $9.6 billion, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected to be down about 2% year over year.In fiscal Q2, ORCL’s earnings of $0.80 per share came in at the high end of the company’s forecasts and exceeded the average analyst estimate of $0.78 per share. Shares jumped 5% immediately after the company reported.Stock Performance Outpacing Overall Market in 2019ORCL shares have really been on a roll so far this year, and are up 25% from the holiday lows that coincided with the rest of the market hitting its lows for 2018.Oracle has a major cloud presence, so investors might want to listen closely to get a sense of how that’s performed since December. Oracle’s two cloud ERP businesses, Fusion ERP and NetSuite ERP, delivered a combined revenue growth rate of 32% in fiscal Q2, the company said. However, ORCL faces intense competition as other players shift to cloud computing. Just this week, Nvidia Corporation NVDA announced the purchase of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. MLNX, a maker of Ethernet switches and adapters that connect computers to each other. This is a move analysts said could give NVDA, a chipmaker, a foothold in the cloud space.Competition is likely to keep increasing, but ORCL has a head start in some ways because of its huge sales and distribution network. It’s a very mature company.Software as a Service (SaaS)—which allows users to subscribe and use application software in the cloud—is an area where ORCL has a heavy presence. One reason the stock might be doing so well is that within 10 years analysts expect the overall SaaS business (for ORCL and competitors) to grow six-fold. It’s a high-margin business already, and many analysts expect those margins to increase.Also, the hardware business is still 10% of ORCL’s revenues. While some analysts note that hardware might weigh on ORCL’s operating margins, companies like Apple Inc AAPL have shown that hardware can be a robust business area. There’s still a place for it, but companies like ORCL have to allocate resources smartly.As ORCL prepared to report, it received a downgrade on Monday from Nomura Instinet, which reduced its price target and expressed concern about the company’s buyback program, MarketWatch reported. The analyst said ORCL’s buybacks could be causing it to underinvest in research and development and might limit its ability to engineer any major merger and acquisition (M&A) activity.Strong Start: Oracle shares (candlestick) are off to a fast start in 2019, as this year-to-date chart shows. They’re roughly keeping pace with the S&P 500 Index (purple line). Data source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: thinkorswim® by TD Ameritrade. Not a recommendation.

Past performance does not guarantee future results.Oracle Options ActivityFor ORCL, the options market has priced in an expected share price move of about 4.2% ($2.23) in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim® platform.Call activity has been higher at the 53.50 and 55 strikes while put activity has concentrated at the 52.50 and 50 strikes. The implied volatility sits at the 39th percentile as of Thursday morning. Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.

57,75,AAPL,Strength Appears To Continue As China Offers Stimulus Plan,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13368664,"Stocks seemed determined to end what’s been a powerful week in the green. A positive tone infused the markets early Friday in part on optimism about China as investors eyed the latest trade news and also viewed more economic stimulus from the Beijing government.We’ll get to the trade developments shortly. However, what appeared to spark Asian markets early Friday and then spread around the world was the Chinese government presenting a plan designed to stimulate growth by cutting taxes. The economy there has been slowing lately, with more soft numbers out earlier this week. So anything the government does to try to stimulate a little more economic activity could be viewed as positive.On the trade front, some caution about negotiations crept into the market earlier this week on concerns about when the two countries’ presidents might meet. But sentiment has been shifting toward confidence as China’s state media on Friday reported progress on the terms of the deal and as President Trump remarked Thursday that China has been “very responsible and very reasonable” in the discussions.  Another bit of overseas news might also be propping up markets early Friday as a vote by the U.K. Parliament to postpone Brexit might have momentarily lifted some concerns about that issue.Investors are likely to also be digesting a bunch of earnings reports after several key companies released their quarterly numbers following Thursday’s closing bell. It looks like a mixed reaction so far. Companies reporting since yesterday’s close included Oracle Corporation ORCL, Adobe Inc ADBE and Broadcom Inc AVGO, among others. Oracle beat Wall Street’s estimates on both top- and bottom-lines, but shares fell. The stock came within a penny of its all-time high Thursday before the company reported. Adobe shares also were down before the opening bell.Meanwhile, shares of Broadcom rose 5% in pre-market trading after a big beat on earnings per share.Volatility WatchThere’s a chance volatility might spike Friday as it’s the quarterly “quadruple witching” day with contracts for stock-index futures, stock-index options, individual stock options and individual stock futures all expiring. Sometimes the market sees more choppiness than usual around quadruple witching as traders rebalance positions, and that could explain some of the up-and-down trading we saw yesterday.In corporate news this morning, Tesla Inc TSLA shares were down 3% premarket as it unveiled a new SUV model it expects to deliver by next year. Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN was up about 1.2% on an analyst upgrade, and home décor retailer Kirkland’s, Inc. KIRK plunged 10% pre-market on the heels of a disappointing earnings report. Also, Newell Brands Inc NWL, with names like Rubbermaid and Sharpie, was up about 1.2% in premarket trade after the CEO announced his pending retirement. The past year, NWL has plunged more than 45%.Chop ShopIf you’re looking for the perfect word to describe Thursday’s session, you could do a lot worse than “chop.” As in, “choppy.” Or “trading both sides of unchanged,” as some market veterans might say. A lack of direction seemed to prevail for most of the session, though the S&P 500 (SPX) did manage to stay above the psychological 2800 level despite a slightly lower close. A technical resistance level to consider watching today is in the 2831-2834 level, an area the SPX has had trouble with in the past.Maybe it’s not all that surprising to see the market look a bit dead Thursday after the run it had Monday through Wednesday. A rise in volatility late Wednesday might have been a sneak preview, perhaps showing a little caution creeping in. It’s been a powerful week, but it’s ending soon. That suggests there could potentially be some profit taking Friday.Data looks a little sparse Friday, but possibly consequential. The Michigan consumer sentiment report could be particularly important after mixed signals from a strong January retail sales report earlier this week conflicted with another tepid new home sales report for January released Thursday. New home sales fell 6.9% month-over-month, but with the brutally cold weather experienced by parts of the U.S. that month, perhaps a soft housing market could be expected. For instance, new home sales fell more than 28% in the Midwest, which was the epicenter of those below-zero temperatures. Not exactly the type of weather that makes people want to go out and shop for a home, unless their furnace is broken.Next week features a Fed meeting (see more below) and earnings from Nike Inc NKE. Existing home sales and factory orders are two of the main economic data points on the weekly agenda.Opposite Direction for YieldsOn a less cautious note, some selling in the Treasury note market helped take 10-year yields a little higher Thursday. At around 2.62% they’re not far off of recent lows, but the bond selling did appear to help Financial shares a bit. Financials had the best day of any sector Thursday and might have been one factor in helping the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) make slight gains. Still, shares of Boeing Co BA continue to weigh on the overall $DJI, as BA fell another 1%. On the other side of the equation, Apple Inc. AAPL has been a hot stock lately and rose 1% Thursday. An analyst note referring to stabilization of sales in China seemed to help shares. AAPL is one of the most widely-held stocks, and when it does well, it seems to help market confidence in general.Some analysts see tough technical resistance for AAPL setting up just above current levels, at around $185 a share. There’s a lot of talk on Wall Street now about AAPL transforming into a services-driven company as concerns grow about iPhone revenue, but we’ll have to wait until the next earnings report for more clarity on that from the company itself. The chip makers got bashed around a bit on Thursday, perhaps a sign of some profit taking after strength earlier in the week. This sub-sector might continue to bear watching as many companies here look to diversify beyond a reliance on video games.Getting back to yields for a minute, Reuters reported Thursday that J.P. Morgan Chase & Co JPM issued a note saying it doesn’t expect the Fed to hike rates this year. Earlier forecasts from JPM predicted two hikes in 2019.The Fed has noted a slowing world economy, but crude oil prices aren’t slowing down. A weak economy can sometimes weigh on crude, but U.S. crude reached a new four-month high Thursday above $58 a barrel. Some of the strength this week had to do with continued OPEC supply cutbacks, but crude can sometimes be a barometer for the global economy. That means its recent rally might say something about demand as well as supply. We’re about a month out from the next OPEC meeting, which we’ll talk more about in coming weeks.From the Middle Seat: Despite the grounding of Boeing’s 737 Max 8 jets, several major airline stocks rose Thursday. That might have raised some investor eyebrows, because one school of thought suggests that BA’s issues might start having a negative impact on travel. If people start getting scared to fly and cancel reservations or if they miss out on trips because the plane they were supposed to go on is grounded, that could affect hotels, airlines, and car rental companies, too. However, it looks like some investors might be looking at airline capacity and taking into account fewer seats in the sky due to the grounding. When airline capacity falls and demand remains the same, airlines sometimes have to raise prices. That could mean more revenue and perhaps a better bottom line for some companies in the space. It’s still early, and analysts pointed out that the Max 8 only makes up a very small portion of total U.S. airplane seat capacity. Still, it could be something to consider, especially if BA’s grounding goes on a while. How long it might last is anyone’s guess, safety experts told the media Thursday. This type of grounding is unprecedented, they said. Past groundings have been for mechanical issues beyond the pilot’s control, whereas this appears to possibly be a software and training issue.Right Around the Corner: Spring? Yes, it is around the corner. We’re talking earnings season, though. It’s just a month away, and that means it’s time once again to look at some estimates for S&P 500 earnings. FactSet predicts a 3.4% S&P 500 earnings decline in Q1, but research firm CFRA is a bit more optimistic, seeing just a 1.9% drop. CFRA projects a dramatic earnings decline for Communication Services companies, and also expects double-digit earnings stumbles for Materials, Energy, Real Estate, and Consumer Discretionary. Only Health Care, Industrials, and Financials will grow their Q1 earnings year-over-year, CFRA predicts.The pessimism among analysts likely reflects in part the fading impact of the 2017 tax cut, which helped lift many companies’ fortunes a year ago. Now they face some very tough year-over-year-comparisons, and that doesn’t change in Q2, Q3, or Q4. That’s why investors might want to pay extra attention to other metrics like revenue and forward guidance this time around, as those might be more reflective of what’s happening today. It doesn’t look like the overall market is worried about earnings declines, as the S&P 500’s forward price-to-earnings ratio stood at around 16.8, slightly above the average of 16.4 since 2000. This might suggest that softer earnings could be built into stock prices already.What If The Fed Meets and No One Comes?: That won’t happen, naturally. Still, next week’s meeting does seem a bit anticlimactic considering the futures market shows virtually no chance of any rate action. Looking further out into the year, the market builds in growing chances of a rate cut, but the thinking on Wall Street now appears to be that the Fed is unlikely to take that step anytime soon out of concern it could raise fears about the economy. Futures prices build in about a 1% chance of a rate cut next week, rising to around 8% by the June meeting. This week’s benign U.S. inflation data, turmoil around Brexit, and weak Chinese economic news—combined with the weak February U.S. job report—arguably don’t suggest the need for the Fed to get hawkish anytime soon.One thing to consider watching, other than Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s post-meeting press conference, is any new insight into the Fed’s balance sheet plans. Late last month, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told CNBC he believes the Fed’s bond holdings reduction program is “near an end” and that he expects a timetable to be finalized “in the next couple of months.” Halting the balance sheet reduction would potentially be one way for the Fed to give the economy a lift without taking the more dramatic step of lowering rates.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

58,78,AAPL,Market Apparently Expects Dovish Fed Stance To Continue As Meeting Gets Underway,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13386462,"There have been two major themes arguably helping to boost stocks this year: A dovish Fed and increasing optimism about a U.S.-China trade deal.With little news on the latter front this morning, focus could turn toward the Fed, which begins its two-day policy meeting today. With the central bank widely expected to hold rates steady this week, that leaves Fed watchers to anticipate whether policy makers will telegraph more thinking on a potential rate trajectory with a change to its dot plot. Another thing the market seems likely to watch for is any new insight into the Fed’s balance sheet plans, as a slowdown or halt to its bond reduction program could be one way for the Fed to try to give the economy a lift without taking the more dramatic step of lowering rates. The meeting concludes tomorrow, followed by a press conference from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.Stocks appeared ready to resume rallying early Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) going for a five-day winning streak even with the fact that Boeing Co BA has shaved about 400 points off the $DJI since the company’s troubles started last week. BA shares were down just a touch in pre-market trading.Between Brexit and BeijingOn the other front that the market has been closely watching, media reports suggest that a summit between President Trump and President Xi of China might not happen until June, but that news didn’t appear to have much of a negative impact Monday. Maybe as long as the two sides are talking and tariffs aren’t moving higher, some investors might be willing to forgive delays. Markets in Asia were mostly lower early Tuesday in slow trading.In other overseas news, the Brexit situation might be worth keeping an eye for its potential effects on European markets and the euro’s relationship to the dollar as more news potentially comes down the pike. The latest reports make it look like there might be a long delay in Brexit. They’re going to play the stall game, it appears, and that might be one factor helping buttress European shares early Tuesday.U.S. stocks might be getting some support from a weaker dollar, as the Dollar Index fell again Monday and remained below recent highs. One thing that might be holding the Fed back could be low rates overseas. The German bund yield is under 0.1%, compared with U.S. 10-year yields that finished just above 2.6% on Monday. That’s a pretty wide divergence. Checking Resistance LevelsThe S&P 500 (SPX) rose again Monday but closed just short of clearing a resistance area between 2831 and 2834, finishing right in the middle of that band. A push above that to close higher on Tuesday, if it happens, might be viewed as a sign of technical strength.Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) has a four-session win streak going. But with Boeing still under pressure, the $DJI again under-performed the SPX on Monday. Some analysts say follow-through buying from Friday’s rally appeared to be a factor Monday on a day when fresh news catalysts were a bit lacking.Cyclicals Led Wall Street To Start WeekFrom a sector perspective, cyclicals shined Monday, which is sometimes seen as a potential sign of underlying investor confidence. Some of the leading sectors included Energy, Financials, Consumer Discretionary, and Industrials.One sector that didn’t do so well was Communication Services, which got weighed on in part by weakness in Facebook, Inc. FB. That company’s stock had its worst day of the year, falling more than 3% amid concern about executive departures and an analyst downgrade. However, the FB softness didn’t extend much to the other FAANGs, as three of the other four rose. Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Apple Inc AAPL - which has been on a roll - were particularly strong. The analyst downgrading FB warned of strategic, regulatory and brand risks, Briefing.com noted.Speaking of downgrades, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM downgraded Yum! Brands, Inc. YUM, sending that stock lower in pre-market trading. Some of the food brands have done well recently, like Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG and McDonald’s Corp MCD, so we’ll see if this is an isolated move or if it spreads.Chipmaker stocks were mostly lower Monday ahead of Micron Technology, Inc. MU earnings later this week. Some analysts are worried about falling chip pricing and how that might factor into the company’s quarter.So far this year, the SPX is up just over 13%, while the DJI is up just above 11%. The Nasdaq Composite (up 16.3%) is out-performing both. Meanwhile, volatility, as measured by VIX, rose just slightly on Monday but remains near 2019 lows just above 13.Crude JumpsU.S. crude prices hit a four-month high and are threatening $60 a barrel after OPEC canceled its April meeting and Saudi Arabia said output cuts might extend into the second half of the year, according to media reports. Crude struggled a bit late last week amid economic fears, but anyone who was hoping OPEC might turn up the spigot or even say a few bearish words at the April meeting was probably disappointed with Monday’s events.One question is whether rising oil prices might start to have an impact on commodity-sensitive stocks. Energy stocks performed well on Monday, which might stand to reason, but so far the higher crude costs haven’t seemed to hurt transportation-related companies. The Dow Jones Transportation Average ($DJT) rose Monday. That index has been recovering the last week after a long slide in early March. This could reflect consumer health.Yielding Less: The yield on the 10-year Treasury has been moving lower in recent sessions. Part of that may be because foreign investors might be piling into U.S. Treasuries to get better yields than they can get at home, boosting Treasury prices, which move inversely to yields. Data Source: Cboe. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Fed Funds Futures: Investors appear to see more of a chance for declining rates than rising ones. While the CME futures market, as of Monday, put chances of any rate move this week at less than 2%, the market shows no chance of a hike at the June meeting and a nearly 15% chance of a rate cut by that time. Looking farther ahead, the futures market sees more than a 25% chance of rates being lower than they are now by the end of the year, and zero chance of them being higher. That’s quite a turn-around from late last year, when historic data shows the futures market was pricing in around a 40% chance of at least one rate hike in 2019.Silver Linings: If we end up seeing strong earnings from FedEx Corporation FDX after the close today and Nike Inc NKE later in the week, it could help to back up what some of the economic data have been telling investors about U.S. consumers being in good shape. It appears consumers are out continuing to spend money and help keep the economy going. That may be a counterpoint to worries about slowing economic growth. True, GDP forecasts have been trimmed and clouds continue hanging over the global trade situation. But it’s not all doom and gloom. Though the February jobs report was disappointing, many analysts are writing it off to some extent due to cold weather that month and the lingering effects of the government shutdown. Other data, including last Friday’s better-than-expected March University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment report and last week’s January retail sales report, arguably could serve as counterweights to the weak jobs data. Affordability Still An Issue: While mortgage rates have been falling, overall home affordability continues to be a headwind for the housing market. “Affordability still remains a key concern for builders,” the National Association of Home Builders said in a press release Monday. “The skilled worker shortage, lack of buildable lots and stiff zoning restrictions in many major metro markets are among the challenges builders face as they strive to construct homes that can sell at affordable price points.” However, more builders are reporting that lower-priced houses are selling well, echoing the data in the new home sales report last week. A report on February existing home sales is due out later this week. It might be interesting to see if a drop in borrowing costs has given consumers new appetite for home buying as mortgage rates have generally been declining since late last year.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

59,79,AAPL,"Fed And FedEx: While Fed Meeting Dominates News, Don't Forget Trade Situation",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13394636,"There’s likely going to be a hunt for direction this morning as investors await the Fed’s latest verdict on the economy and its thoughts on the future direction of interest rates. It wouldn’t be all that surprising to see some slow trade ahead of the Fed meeting. Things are often a little dull on Fed days, though there’s really not too much drama associated with the Fed’s decision today the way there was at the December meeting. That was the last time the Fed raised rates, but since then it’s adopted a dovish pose. Chances of a rate move this afternoon are near zero, according to the futures market. More on the central bank below.While the Fed might be in focus today, it’s also important not to forget about the trade situation. As a reminder of its importance, consider the earnings report from FedEx Corporation FDX after yesterday’s close. The company’s shares fell more than 6% in pre-market trading this morning after FDX missed Wall Street’s earnings and revenue projections. FDX also lowered guidance. What was one factor behind the miss?  As the company said in its earnings release, “Slowing international macroeconomic conditions and weaker global trade growth trends continue.”That sounds like a pretty solid reason to hope for some sort of trade resolution, and not just with China. Remember, the U.S. also has trade issues with Europe, and Congress hasn’t approved last year’s revised trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. All this helps create uncertainty for companies like FDX.Media reports today suggest that the U.S. and China will continue negotiations next week.Overseas, the Brexit situation remains a bit confusing. There were reports early today that Prime Minister Theresa May will ask for a three-month delay. That would push the March 29 deadline back until late June, but the idea needs E.U. approval. Overseas stocks were mixed early Wednesday, and crude oil took a step back after approaching $60 a barrel yesterday. It’s still near four-month highs.Will Fed See Things the Market’s Way?There appears to be a dichotomy going into today’s Fed decision and its release of an updated “dot plot” showing where Fed officials think rates might go in coming years. The last dot plot showed the Fed still penciling in rising rates, but investors now see rates likely falling over the coming months and years, according to futures trading.The question is whether the updated dot plot due today might factor in the recent economic slowdown around the world that’s pushing bond yields lower and also causing the spread between relatively high U.S. yields and very low European yields to widen. The Fed isn’t expected to make any rate changes today, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference following the 2 p.m. EDT decision, along with the dot plot release, might help investors fill in some of the blanks about the long-term rate picture.Stocks have been on a tear thanks in part to the Fed’s desire to stay “patient,” and watch the data come in. At the same time, U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields are just above 2.6%, back near January lows but still way above the benchmark European yield. Futures prices at the CME show no chance of a rate hike and less than a 2% chance of a rate cut today. By the June meeting, chances of a cut in rates rise to above 9%, and futures factor in about a 22% chance of the Fed cutting rates by year-end.As we’ve also been saying, investors might want to listen this afternoon for any updates on the Fed’s balance sheet plans. Powell arguably walks a fine line on the balance sheet going into the meeting. A move by the Fed to announce the planned end its balance sheet unwinding, which it has hinted at, might be seen as positive from a market perspective but negative from an economic one. It seems like the Fed has spent the last few months preparing investors for possible dovish moves like that, as Powell and others continue to note slowing economic growth. The risk, potentially, would be for the Fed to take this step more quickly than investors had expected. Such a move might be seen as a sign that the economy is worse than investors may have thought.On the other hand, lack of action to slow or stop the unwinding could be seen as the Fed getting behind the curve, so to speak.Also, we’ll see if Powell says anything about where he and other Fed officials now see the so-called “neutral” short-term interest rate. That’s the level where the Fed would see rates not being too tight or too loose. In December, this level ranged between 2.5% and 3.5%, according to Fed officials. The Fed’s benchmark rate now is between 2.25% and 2.5%. If the neutral level comes down, The Wall Street Journal noted, that could imply that the Fed sees less need for future rate hikes.See-Saw Action Tuesday Amid Conflicting Trade ReportsTuesday’s market looked like a trade tug of war between conflicting reports, with stocks getting pulled back and forth for much of the day amid confusion about progress in U.S./China talks. One media outlet reported difficulties, taking stocks lower, but then another outlet reported the negotiations might be nearing the finish line. With investors apparently unsure about the situation, the market veered toward the flat-line after initially rallying. By the end of the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s ($DJI) four-day win streak was over.The quick downturn after an early rally once again might indicate just how closely the market appears to be following negotiations. A lot of reports lately said the talks could spill over well into June, so the jumpiness probably isn’t going away anytime soon.Though Boeing Co BA got beaten down the last two weeks due to safety concerns, investors might want to also keep in mind that both BA and Caterpillar Inc CAT have also been seen as barometers of the China situation, since both companies do so much business there. That’s why it might be important to watch their performance in coming weeks to potentially get some insight into market optimism or pessimism about tariffs. Shares of the two companies were mixed Tuesday, with neither making any steep moves in either direction.Another area that could be worth watching for trade sentiment is semiconductors, which have been outpacing the overall market gains since the start of the year. These companies tend to have a higher than typical exposure to the China market. In some ways, one could argue that semiconductor companies have taken the lead so far this year and have helped provide momentum across other parts of the market, kind of the way the FAANGs did last year. One big gainer in the chip space Tuesday was Nvidia Corporation NVDA, up more than 6% as the company hosted a tech conference that included product announcements. Another was Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, which rose 11% after news reports that AMD would partner with Google on a game streaming platform.Preparing for the Worst?If things start to look sketchy on the China negotiations, that might be picked up in some of the stocks that typically are seen as having less China exposure, including Utilities, Real Estate, and Consumer Staples. Strength in the Treasury market or a rise in the VIX (the market’s most closely watched volatility indicator) might also indicate investor concerns about the China situation.Speaking of Treasuries, yields remained pretty muted Tuesday as the Fed gathered. The 10-year yield was at around 2.6% early Wednesday, while the two-year was at 2.46%. That spread is sometimes watched, because a flat or an inverted curve—in which the longer-term Treasury yield falls below the shorter-term yield—has sometimes been associated with receptions. That spread fell to single-digits late last year, but has been pretty steady in the teens for weeks.On the data front, investors might want to stay tuned Thursday for February leading indicators and the March Philadelphia Fed Index. Factory orders for January rose just 0.1%, a bit below Wall Street’s consensus. Like other reports from that month, it might be helpful to take that one with a grain of salt due to the government shutdown and bad weather.Financials Rally Into Fed: The Financial sector (candlestick) had a rough day Tuesday, but has rallied from recent lows going into the Fed meeting. Part of the strength could stem from thoughts that low rates might raise loan demand. However, Info Tech (purple line) is up much more sharply over the last month. Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Deutsche’s Woes: This week struggling Deutsche Bank AG DB said it’s considering merging with its rival in Commerzbank, a strategy favored by German’s ministry of finance for several months. In the past year, DB’s shares have plunged more than 40% as it undergoes a restructuring plan that includes significant job cuts. The German lender has been riddled with setbacks since the financial crisis of 2008, including facing billions fines over issues like its role in toxic mortgage assets, a money-laundering scheme and interest rate manipulation. In Q4, Deutsche reported a net loss that fell short of estimates, although it reported its first full-year profit since 2014. Some third-party analysts say a merger with Commerzbank would help Deutsche and the German banking system recover, but others aren’t so sure. Apple Event Looming?: Technology giant Apple Inc. AAPL is reportedly gearing up to announce a new media and entertainment service at an event scheduled for early next week, according to Bloomberg. It appears to analysts that AAPL is trying to lean on service-type revenue as its revenue from iPhones has been a bit lackluster, down 15% in the company’s fiscal Q1. Its video streaming service is expected to include free original content and paid subscription options for content from companies like Starz and Showtime. While AAPL’s plans for new services are attracting attention, it’s not giving up on hardware efforts. AAPL just rolled out an update to its iMac desktop that includes faster processors and new graphics chips. It also revamped its iPad mini and iPad Air.‘Tis the Season—for IPOs: With the start of spring, initial public offerings (IPOs) seem to be in the air along with the chirping of robins and the sound of baseballs hitting the bat. Some of the companies that might launch IPOs soon include popular technology and customer service firms, so the names are likely to be familiar to many. However, investors should consider keeping a cautious outlook. How many times in recent years have we seen a stock have an IPO with a lot of publicity, only to crater soon after opening day? Sometimes people confuse a company and a business. You may love the product, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you have to love the stock, too. The problem with IPOs is that many people rush in with both hands, but it might be worth waiting to see what the stocks do. Or, if you do jump on an IPO, you might want to consider only buying shares in partial increments and not going all in at once. People are excited to invest in these companies, and it’s exciting that retail investors are getting these opportunities, but they should probably keep the potential downside in mind. People don’t plan for things going down, and that’s when they often get into trouble.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

60,80,AAPL,How Google's Stadia Video Game Streamer Will Be 'Highly Disruptive',https://www.benzinga.com/node/13393958,"For a while, Alphabet Inc GOOGL GOOG was content with its Google Maps Easter Egg games. Now, it’s ready for the big leagues.Management announced Tuesday it will break into video games with a new streaming service, gaming hardware and content. Analysts are thrilled.Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts Justin Post and Benjamin Sherlund maintained a Buy rating and $1,350 price target on Alphabet. KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts Evan Wingren and Andy Hargreaves maintained an Overweight rating and $1,430 target, while Tigress Financial managing partner Ivan Feinseth recommends purchase.The ThesesGoogle’s “Stadia” streaming service will live in the company cloud, open in Chrome or Chromecast, and require no console or download to play. While Google will market Stadia controllers, the system will be compatible with any device and third-party controller.The service, slated for launch in 2019, is seen to be a boon for both publishers and Google.“By offering a platform to gamers without the high barriers of entry of traditional gaming (expensive PCs or consoles), Google may expand the gaming market for AAA content (mobile market has over 2 billion players),” Post and Sherlund wrote in a note. “With YouTube being the ‘lobby’ for game access and Stadia offering the ability push to connect to games from YouTube, Stadia could be a tailwind to YouTube engagement and monetization.”Feinseth agreed that YouTube integration yields significant growth and upside opportunities.Analysts anticipate competition from Microsoft Corporation MSFT, which is already established in the content and console space, as well as Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Apple Inc. AAPL.Roll-Out Hold-UpsKeyBanc also suspects internet mechanics may prove inhibitive in the near term.“Although we came away very impressed by the rollout, we believe internet speed could remain a material bottleneck for global adoption,” Wingren and Hargreaves wrote.Bank of America Merrill Lynch noted that, if latency issues are overcome, Google stands to reap big rewards.“If the service can launch with low latency as expected, we think Stadia will demonstrate the potential power of the Google cloud network in a 5G world (which could power the Internet of Things [IoT] and self-driving autos),” Post and Sherlund wrote. “Investors could, in turn, be more optimistic on capex investments.”Secondary EffectsStadia could remove barriers to the gaming industry as it cuts consumer costs, download time, and hardware or connectivity limitations.“If Google can deliver on its promises, this technology has the potential to be highly disruptive; it is promising an ambitious service that can deliver 4K (and even 8K) gaming at scale globally that is ubiquitous and cross platform with low latency,” Wingren and Hargreaves wrote. “This is the holy grail for game makers.”It is seen to expand the total addressable market for publishers like Activision Blizzard, Inc. ATVI, Electronic Arts Inc. EA and Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. TTWO.“By moving the compute power to the network, Google would help to accelerate the streaming transition, open up gaming to new players and allow for more advanced game play such as Battle Royal modes with 1,000s of players which was previously not possible,” Post and Sherlund wrote.As Google builds its market, Bank of America Merrill Lynch expects publisher collaborations, content licensing deals or acquisitions of content studios.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD may see more action, too. Google is using custom AMD chips for Stadia services but may see fit to expand the relationship.""The new AMD/Alphabet partnership creates a significant opportunity for AMD and opens up the possibility that AMD chips could be used in other Alphabet/Google applications,"" Feinseth wrote.Related Links:Battle Royale: Morgan Stanley Cautiously Upbeat On EA, ActivisionSnap Reportedly Set To Launch Gaming Platform In April",2019-03-20
61,81,AAPL,Light Goes From Green To Red As Weak European Data Puts Brakes On U.S. Rally,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13408593,"Renewed global growth fears might dim the rally lights a little Friday after yesterday’s Fed party.A sharp rally Thursday that led stocks to five-month highs hit the brakes in pre-market action after European stocks fell sharply amid more soft data. Factory output in Europe slumped to its lowest level since 2013, helping send benchmark German 10-year yields fell below zero for the first time in more than two years. U.S. data might be strong, but it’s not getting matched overseas. That’s causing some worries now that might be reflected in Treasury note strength here.The other factor that appears to be weighing on the market early Friday is Nike Inc NKE, which fell nearly 5% in pre-market trading after the company’s earnings data received a negative reaction.Though NKE matched analysts’ revenue expectations and beat third-party consensus on earnings per share, the stock fell nearly 4% in post-market trading. The news media immediately focused on what some analysts called disappointing North American sales growth. Sales in the region did climb 7%, but just missed the Street’s estimates.There were high expectations going into NKE earnings, especially after Foot Locker Inc. FL crushed Wall Street estimates for Q3, citing in part success with Nike products. One thing to keep in mind as NKE trades today is the other side of the world, namely China, where NKE saw its fastest quarterly growth of any region. Consider thinking about how those results might fit into the China picture, where we’ve seen some U.S. companies run into trouble recently while others continue to perform well. Speaking of China, U.S. negotiators head back across the Pacific next week to continue trade talks, but some media outlets are reporting that U.S. sanctions on two Chinese companies for allegedly helping North Korea’s nuclear program could be a new source of tension.There was also some more bad news for Boeing Inc BA early Friday as Indonesia canceled an approximately $5 billion order for 49 of BA’s Max jets.All these fresh concerns appear to be injecting a bit more volatility into the U.S. picture. The VIX—the market’s most closely watched fear indicator—shot back up to well over 14 early Friday from lows under 13 earlier this week. When VIX goes up, sometimes trading can get a little choppy. We’re also nearing the end of the quarter, a time when some fund managers traditionally start to do some position squaring. Sometimes that can cause volatility as well.Fed-Led Rally Just Took A Day To Get StartedThe Fed rally finally started Thursday; it just took a little time to come together. One night, actually. It also happened to leave one sector—Financials—almost completely behind.After a sputtering finish Wednesday following the Fed’s dovish announcement, stocks got a wind at their back Thursday and finished with a flourish. The S&P 500 Index (SPX) rose more than 1% to finish at its highest level since early October. The Nasdaq (COMP) and Russell 2000 (RUT) outpaced the SPX. Even the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI), still burdened by Boeing, finished much higher.We’ll get to the “dogs of the Dow” in a minute. First, let’s check what’s carrying this rally. First, it’s hard to overlook the strong performance of Apple Inc AAPL over recent weeks. The stock got an analyst upgrade Thursday ahead of next Monday’s event where many analysts expect AAPL to announce some sort of streaming service. Shares of AAPL are knocking on the door of $200 again, up 37% from their January low.AAPL’s shiny performance might have rubbed off on other stocks, and not just in Information Technology. It’s usually good for the market overall when AAPL is up, possibly because it’s so widely-held. It’s interesting to see what the upgrading analyst wrote about AAPL, stressing that some fears are overblown and that the company could continue to have steady growth. The analyst also said the price point issue—meaning some customers’ shock at seeing $1,000 phones—is fading. As many analysts have said, services is probably AAPL’s more exciting area now, because at some point phones will become commoditized. We aren’t quite there yet. At that point, arguably the importance of services would grow, but the problem with services is they’re a lower-margin product.Semiconductors Leading ChargeLeaving AAPL for a moment, it’s also hard to overlook the semiconductors, a sector that got beaten down last year and saw many stocks get their values cut in half. Things have changed in a big way since then, with semis on a real tear lately amid hopes for a resolution on China tariffs and as solid U.S. economic data points to possible demand growth for electronic goods. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD is up nearly 27% since its March low posted less than two weeks ago. Nvidia Corporation NVDA and Micron Technology, Inc. MU are also making noise. Shares of all three companies rose more than 5% Thursday, with MU up nearly 10%. This is despite some supply issues in the industry that continue to weigh on pricing. Generally, however, stocks such as semis that have some China growth exposure seem to be doing well.Home builders are also coming back as investors watch mortgage rates fall (see more below). Solid data from the Philadelphia Fed and a decent leading indicators report appeared to help the overall market Thursday as investors await existing home sales Friday. Consumer goods and consumer sentiment are both doing well, so the question is whether housing can join the party.Financials Miss OutWe already discussed DJIA component BA not participating in Thursday’s surge, but the other companies left out of the party were mainly Financials. This was the only sector to fall on Thursday.Some of the second-level banks took it on the chin Wednesday after the Fed meeting, and it was red pretty much across the board for banks on Thursday as investors pondered the prospect of an extended period of low rates. JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM, a DJIA component, was one of just a handful of DJIA stocks to fall Thursday. Goldman Sachs GS, another DJIA member, managed very slight gains, and Wells Fargo & Co WFC also fell.Looking ahead from a technical perspective, it seems that 2865 might form an area of resistance in the SPX, just about 10 points above Thursday’s close. The SPX has had just a bit of trouble pushing through resistance lately, getting held up for a week near 2800 and then for a day or two around 2831. However, both those levels are well behind and the market is on a spectacular run.See You Later: As they often do, the S&P 500 (candlestick) and the VIX (purple line) have gone their separate ways over the last year, as this chart shows. VIX ticked up early Friday, but remains below its historic average level of around 15 as the S&P 500 hits new five-month highs. Data Sources: S&P Dow Jones Indices, Cboe. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  Borrowing a Page: It isn’t just U.S. borrowing costs going down after this week’s Fed meeting. The German bund yield fell sharply and is now trading around zero. Japanese and other European yields also dropped dramatically. While the U.S. 10-year yield now sits around 2.5%—just 10 basis points above where it was to start 2018—it still holds a heavy premium to those other interest rate products, so overseas investors might keep seeking yield here. If that happens, U.S. yields could potentially fall even lower. Today’s existing home sales report looks backward to February when borrowing costs were a bit higher, but maybe future housing reports might show some impact from lower rates. A possible beneficiary? The Financial Sector. Traditionally, Financials tend to do better when the housing market is strong and people are out there borrowing money and taking on loans. Another sector that could benefit, naturally, is home building. Thursday saw shares of home builder D.R. Horton Inc DHI rise more than 3%. Bond “Proxies” Appear to Like Fed News: S&P 500 Utility sector stocks are outpacing the S&P 500 Index (SPX) over the last month and were up sharply Thursday as it appears some investor money could be seeking higher yield in what analysts call “bond proxy” stocks. Utilities are one of those sectors, along with Consumer Staples and Real Estate, and all three did well Thursday after the Fed news. With Treasury yields falling about 70 basis points since last fall and the Fed no longer forecasting hikes in 2019, that could accelerated a trend that potentially favors these sectors, which tend to offer higher dividends. The S&P 500 dividend yield recently stood at 1.99%, up from 1.86% a year ago. That’s below 10-year note yields, but there’s a chance some investors might start to gravitate toward dividend yielders, considering the narrowing yield gap with Treasuries and the fact that traditionally, stocks have tended to outperform bonds. China Market Perks Up: It’s still early in 2019, but so far the year looks a lot brighter than 2018 did for stocks in China. So far this year, the Shanghai Composite is up more than 24% (through mid-week). That’s well ahead of the S&P 500’s (SPX) roughly 13% climb year-to-date. Some of the China strength might stem from hopes of a resolution to the U.S./China trade battle, but you also can’t rule out the possibility that China’s recent wave of government stimulus might be playing a role. The potentially worrisome thing is that various stimulus programs by the Beijing government already helped trigger a building boom over the last decade or two that’s contributed to rising debt across much of the country, according to media reports. It’s also left unfinished construction projects in many places and has helped send the government’s debt to gross domestic product (GDP) soaring.This all might not end up mattering much, because after all people have been talking about a China “debt bubble” for years, and the economy keeps growing. There are still hundreds of millions of rural Chinese who could represent a future market for goods and services. That said, economic growth has trailed off over the last year as the government starts to clamp down on borrowing, making some economists wonder if the foundation for the market rally there might be a little shaky.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

62,82,AAPL,What Everybody Is Saying Ahead Of Apple's Streaming Video Event,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13410612,"Apple, Inc. AAPL is expected to unveil its highly anticipated Apple TV streaming video service on Monday. The special event takes place at Apple headquarters in Cupertino starting at 1 p.m. ET.Monday’s EventApple investors are hoping the company reveals key details about the streaming service such as pricing and launch date. CNBC reported iPhone and iPad users could also get free access to original content.But while speculation has run wild about what's coming on Monday, Recode cited people who have spoken to Apple about its plans who claim Apple is not yet ready to take on Neflix, Inc. NFLX and will instead be focusing on distribution of third-party streaming video subscriptions.Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said the streaming giant decided not to integrate its service with Apple’s platform, telling reporters the company doesn’t want to “get too distracted” with what competitors are doing.The streaming service is a key part of the Apple bull thesis, which is centered around Services segment growth picking up the slack of plateauing iPhone sales. Several analysts have weighed in on the impact Apple investors can expect from the streaming service. Here’s a sampling of what they’ve had to say.Monetizing iPhone UsersTigress Financial's Ivan Feinseth said the new streaming video and rumored subscription magazine service will help further monetize Apple’s iPhone user base of more than 900 million customers.“The new services will be integrated as part of an iPhone and iPad software update iOS 12.2 which also includes an update to Apple Pay, which will support the new credit card partnership with Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS,” Feinseth wrote in his daily newsletter.Needham analyst Laura Martin said the streaming service will make Apple’s 900 million iPhone users more valuable than ever.""Our 1Q19 proprietary survey tells us that, whether or not Wall Street believes AAPL is an ecosystem company, its users do,"" Martin wrote.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said he values the streaming business at $15 per Apple share.“If Apple executes with minimal speed bumps and aggressively acquires content, given the company’s massive installed base and unmatched brand loyalty we believe reaching 100 million subs in the medium term (3 to 5 years) is a realistic goal that could translate into a $7 billion to $10 billion annual revenue stream over time for Apple and further cement its installed base and halo effect,” Ives wrote.iPhone Sales Still The Cash CowRaymond James analyst Chris Caso said Apple’s iPhone business is so large, the streaming service would have to be three times the size of Netflix’s current business to have a meaningful impact on Apple earnings.“While we don't yet know the full details of the offerings, we think we know enough to be able to make modeling assumptions, and even during the event Apple won't typically provide many financial details aside from pricing,” Caso wrote.Citi analyst Jim Suva said that, despite aggressive streaming platform and content spending, Apple will likely raise its buyback authorization by $100 billion in April and continue to generate $60 billion and $65 billion in cash flow per year.“From a holdings perspective, Apple shares are no longer in the SP500 Growth Index Funds and have completely transitioned to being represented in the Value Index Fund, yet in our marketing meetings, many growth investors have a negative view on the shares with short interest as a % of free float the highest it has ever been over the past 2 years,” Suva wrote.Ratings And Price Targets
Wedbush has an Outperform rating and $215 target.
Raymond James has a Market Perform rating and no target.
Needham has a Strong Buy rating and $225 target.
Citi has a Buy rating and $220 target.

63,84,AAPL,"Apple Rolls Out Streaming Service Apple TV+, TV Channels",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13418708,"Apple Inc. AAPL rolled out its much-awaited video streaming move with Apple TV+ and Apple TV Channels on Monday, along with other expanded services for delivering games and news articles for subscribers for single monthly fees.Apple is seeking to be the go-to place for TV and movie watchers, gamers and news readers - eventually seen by many as a competitor with Netflix, Inc. NFLX for TV and movie viewers while trying to replicate that model by also offering a one-stop shop for games and news. In a star-studded roll-out that included Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey and Steve Carell, among others, Apple CEO Tim Cook rolled out an expanded vision for Apple as an entertainment and information service provider rather than just a producer of computers and phones.Apple TV+ And Apple TV ChannelsApple TV+ will include original Apple programming - as Netflix has done, with a library of original content hinted at by the stars who were at the Apple rollout.Spielberg announced he will work on a TV series called “Amazing Stories” for Apple TV+, while Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell were shown off as the hosts of a new morning show.Apple also is creating a digital entertainment hub where users can bundle their various subscriptions. The app will let users pay for other streaming services, including HBO, Showtime and others, through the Apple app. That part of Apple's service is called Apple Channels.""This is how TV should work,"" said Apple's Peter Stern. ""Now it does with Apple Channels.... No more bouncing around from app to app.”Netflix won’t be a part of that. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said recently it's choosing not to integrate its streaming service with Apple’s as part of an effort to keep control of Netflix users’ experience. The Apple TV app, already available on iPads, iPhones, will also be available on Macs and various smart TVs, as well as Roku Inc ROKU and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN Fire TV devices.See Also: Raymond James Says Apple's Streaming Plans Are 'More Incremental Than Revolutionary,' Which Is A Good Thing For NetflixMove To ServicesCook noted the iconic tech company has long delivered services like its mapping and music services along with its better-known hardware products like computers and smartphones. But the company is shifting heavily toward services as sales of the company’s signature product, the iPhone have hit a plateau.Apple products like the iPhone aren’t becoming obsolete – in fact some analysts see the move as a new way for the Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple to earn money from its iPhone user base, which is closing in on 1 billion customers worldwide. But Apple is transitioning more to a content delivery company.Apple ArcadeApple also announced its subscription game service called Apple Arcade. The service won’t allow streaming play, but is more like a subscription service for games that can be downloaded from the App Store. Subscribers will also be able to try out games.Cook announced that more than 1 billion gamers have downloaded games from the App Store.See Also: What To Know About Apple News+, The Tech Giant's News Subscription ServiceApple News+Apple also announced a new $9.99 per month subscription service called Apple News + that will give users access to articles from more than 300 newspapers and magazines. It starts this month and is free for the first month.Apple said magazines including National Geographic, The New Yorker and Wired will be included, along with newspapers including the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal.Cook and other Apple officials touted privacy throughout the presentation, including with the news service. The company said it won’t let advertisers track Apple News+ users.Apple CardApple also rolled out changes to its credit-card like online payment service with an expansion of its popular Apple Pay service to be called Apple Card. It allows people to pay for products using personal devices with an online credit card. The service is in partnership with Goldman Sachs GS and Mastercard MS, which will create widespread acceptance, the company says.Price ActionApple's stock was down 1.9 percent after the presentation to $187.33 per share.",2019-03-25
64,86,AAPL,"Yields Still Center Stage, But A Slight Uptick Appears To Loosen Chokehold On Market",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13424800,"Earlier this year, the latest rumors about trade negotiations with China could sometimes send U.S. stocks off to the races or into the pits. These days, it looks like moves in the interest rate complex might be having the same impact.With China talks simmering but not sizzling, interest rates now appear to be the main focus. There’s still an inversion in the Treasury market, with three-month yields slightly higher than 10-year yields, but the 10-year yield narrowed the gap a little early Tuesday and that appeared to put some cheer into the market after Friday and Monday’s yield-related slide.The yield curve inversion has spooked some investors because in the past, inversions often preceded recessions. However, as we often say, past isn’t always prologue. No one is too good at predicting recessions, and the Fed still expects better than 2% U.S. gross domestic product growth this year. That doesn’t mean a recession can’t happen, only that the yield curve inversion isn’t necessarily proof that one is coming.Anyone interested in the Treasury market might want to pay attention today as the U.S. Treasury plans to auction $26 billion in 52-week bills and $40 billion in two-year notes. That auction might get watched more closely than usual considering the inversion.Tuesday also brought fresh data in the form of housing starts and building permits for February, and both numbers came in below Wall Street analysts’ estimates. Housing starts were down nearly 9% from the previous month. If you’re looking for silver lining, January housing starts did get revised upward, but generally the report could continue to raise concerns about demand for new homes.The Conference Board’s March consumer confidence number is also in the works today. The confidence number, which can often shape investors’ thoughts on future consumer spending, was pretty strong last time out, so we’ll see if that continued into the early spring.Remember, soft data last week is one reason other than rates that the market stumbled, so this week’s data batch might get a little more focus than normal to see if the U.S. economy is holding up OK.Apple’s AAPL big announcement Monday didn’t appear to help the stock too much, but it’s had a nice run for a while and maybe this was a “buy the rumor, sell the news” situation. AAPL continues to emphasize services like streaming as it sees iPhone sales apparently cresting, but the issue with services, as we’ve said before, is that the margins just aren’t as strong. Shares rose in pre-market trading Tuesday.In premarket moves this morning, Bed Bath & Beyond BBBY surged more than 20% after a Wall Street Journal report said that three activist investors were planning a proxy fight to replace the company’s entire board, saying it has been too slow to pivot toward consumers’ online shopping demands. As we’ve seen over the last few years, retail companies that don’t successfully make the online move often get punished by the market.Technical Safety Net TornThe new week started pretty much where the old one left off, with U.S. markets burdened Monday by global growth worries. Though the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) made a marginal gain Monday, the Nasdaq (COMP) and S&P 500 (SPX) stayed under pressure. The SPX fell below 2800, a key psychological support point. This could conceivably set the market up for a test of the 200-day moving average down around 2755, according to technical analysts.In one minor positive note, the Russell 2000 Index (RUT) of small-caps managed to put the brakes on a its skid, but it’s still down around 6% over the last month (see more below). Sometimes the RUT has been the first index to indicate a change of sentiment, as it was last summer when it started to come off the rails about a month before the SPX lost its footing. Past isn’t necessarily prologue, however.Interest rates continue to draw headlines, with the U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yield at one point falling Monday to its lowest level since December 2017 and finishing the day near 2.4%. That’s down from 2.68% at the start of the year and 2019 highs near 2.8%. By early Tuesday, the 10-year had climbed to 2.44%.At times like this, it helps to keep an eye on the global economy. Despite the low U.S. rates, they remain well above the zero rate of Germany and the 0.35% rate in France. For now, the U.S. economy, at least judging from the bond market, remains the belle of the ball, so to speak.Treasury Market—Why Should Stock Investors Care?
A lot of investors might wonder why they should care so much about rates if they’re not trading fixed income. What do rates have to do with the stock market, they might ask. A lot, actually. They can affect multinational U.S. companies in a big way.When the gap between U.S. and overseas yields starts to widen, as it is now even with the pressure on U.S. yields, that often can mean money heading into the dollar. The U.S. Dollar Index lost a touch of ground Monday and traded at around 96.54, which is down from recent highs above 97.50 but well above where it was a year ago when it scraped 90. One thing to consider watching is the path of the Dollar Index from here. It’s been in a pattern of setting higher lows when it does go down, sometimes a sign of strength. The dollar slide a little early Tuesday, which also might be helping stocks.A stronger dollar can often pose issues for multinational companies by making their products seem more expensive to foreign customers. Earnings recently from both Nike Inc NKE and Tiffany & Co TIF might serve as good lessons about the impact of interest rates on companies. Both of these U.S. companies have a big presence overseas, and they arguably could be feeling the impact of a strong dollar to some extent. Earnings season might help provide clues on how widespread the dollar issue is getting.Financials Continue to SagThe other thing stock market investors often see at times of lower rates is a soft Financial sector, and that continued to be the case early this week. Financials once again were some of the worst performers on Monday as investors continue to seem worried that weak economic growth both here and overseas could hurt the banks’ businesses. Lower rates often mean lower profits for financial institutions (see more below), so it could be very illuminating in mid-April to hear what key bank CEOs have to say about the economy.The pendulum has swung really hard against the banks. A year ago, Financial stocks got rewarded at times because there was widespread belief that interest rates were heading up. It was a frustrating sector for many to trade however, with a lot of stop-and-go.It’s been mostly “stop” recently after Financials had a decent start to the year.  The sector is down more than 4% over the last month compared to slight gains for the SPX.The scramble toward fixed income and bond proxy-stocks like Real Estate and Utilities continued at the start of the week, but not as fiercely as on Friday. Utilities and Real Estate both rose slightly, while another so-called “defensive” sector, Consumer Staples, fell a bit.Meanwhile, volatility—which gained dramatically late last week—continued to slip Monday. The VIX ended the day around 16.3, down from highs above 17 on Friday but still well above last week’s lows of under 13. Looking back, the VIX might have been playing its historic role of being a warning sign for investors. Historically, a low VIX has often signaled weakness in stocks. One thing to potentially watch for if VIX stays elevated is any reaction from the “defensive” sectors we discussed higher up. Recall that last fall, when most of the market was cratering and VIX was above 20 for months, a lot of the Consumer Staples stocks actually did pretty well. Sometimes, though not always, stocks in Staples and Utilities can weather volatility better than some other sectors. Conagra (CAG), a well-known Staple, had another strong day Monday. Colgate-Palmolive CL also rose, as did Procter & Gamble Co PG.SMALL FRIED: It’s been a rough month for the Russell 2000 (RUT) small-cap index, which has fallen sharply even while the S&P 500 (purple line) is pretty much flat. Some economists say small-caps can sometimes be a leading indicator, either positive or negative. Data source: FTSE Russell, S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Talking Techs: Though the psychological 2800 level marks a near-term support/resistance level for the S&P 500 (SPX), according to analysts, a plunge below that might potentially open up the way toward another test of the 200-day moving average. That number now stands near 2755, and the SPX pushed above the 200-day last month for the first time since last year’s holiday-season sell-off. The 2750 level might have broader significance. Looking back over the last year, it arguably forms kind of a pivot point, with the SPX spending about half its time above that level and half below. The index keeps being drawn toward it like a moth to a flame, whether from above or below. Another thing technical traders sometimes keep an eye on is stochastics, and the SPX’s fast stochastic has fallen over the last week from levels that traditionally signal “overbought” into a more normal range. It’s been in the “overbought” range most of this year.RUT Rout: Small-caps took by far the biggest losses in last Friday’s sell-off, with the small-cap Russell 2000 (RUT) falling more than 3%. The RUT took a beating in part because it’s exposed than the S&P 500 (SPX) to the banking sector, with banks making up about one-quarter of the index. The entire Financial sector has been under pressure lately from dovish Fed policy and worries about economic slowing in the U.S. and around the world. In addition, the RUT’s having its worst monthly under-performance vs. the SPX since 2002, Bloomberg noted. While the SPX is about flat over the last month, the RUT is down nearly 6%. For anyone who believes the old market adage about small stocks sometimes being a leading indicator for the overall market, that number probably doesn’t look too promising. However, it’s always a good idea to take the old adages in stride. Remember what they say about economists predicting 10 of the last seven recessions.Seeking Guidance: The last “earnings recession,” meaning two quarters in a row or more of falling year-over-year earnings, occurred back in 2015-2016 and marked a shaky time for markets around the world. With many analysts expecting year-over-year earnings to fall 2% or more in Q1, worries about an earnings recession are starting to creep in again. However, some recent estimates for Q1 earnings results have been rising a little from their lows, and many analysts don’t expect earnings losses in Q2 and beyond. This is an evolving situation and we won’t really know anything until we go through earnings and see the actual numbers. Arguably the key thing to watch once Q1 earnings season starts is forward guidance from the major S&P 500 companies, which likely could give a lot more insight into how Q2 and the rest of the year might be shaping up. Some sort of resolution to the China tariff situation might help give companies more clarity, and U.S. and China negotiators are meeting this week.Image Sourced From Google",2019-03-26
65,88,AAPL,"Apple As A Service: Analysts Break Down Apple TV+, Apple News+ And Apple Arcade",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13424710,"Apple, Inc. AAPL had one of its most important new service unveilings in recent memory on Monday, giving fans their first glimpse at streaming service Apple TV+, subscription gaming service Apple Arcade and news service Apple News+. Unfortunately for investors, Apple didn't disclose several key details, including pricing for Apple TV+, pricing for Apple Arcade, guidance for content spending or any launch dates for the new services.Several Wall Street analysts have weighed in on Apple following the event, many of which were disappointed with the lack of clarity Apple provided. Here’s a sampling of what they had to say.Pricing Is KeyBank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said that, unfortunately, pricing is key for the streaming video and gaming services.“As with any subscription service, user adoption depends on the price at which the service is offered, and any bundling of services which Apple may introduce,” Mohan wrote in a note.Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz said Apple TV+ pricing is the biggest unanswered question following the event.“Overall, it appears that Apple's new services provide better solutions to solve relatively niche problems in media business and they may prompt existing iOS users to stay more invested in Apple's ecosystem,” Uerkwitz wrote.JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee said Apple’s event provided more breadth than investors expected but less depth.“Most incremental and differentiated to us appears to be the positioning of Apple Card, while Apple Arcade is also favorably positioned given limited similar services on offer,” Chatterjee wrote.See Also: What To Know About Apple News+, The Tech Giant's News Subscription ServiceMonetizing User BaseTigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth said the new services will help Apple better monetize its massive installed iPhone user base over time.“I believe upside to the $220 to $240 range exists over the next 12 months and continue to recommend purchase,” Feinseth wrote.UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said the lack of details was frustrating, but the event marked a clear turning point for Apple.“While recognizing the potential for the stock to consolidate some of these gains post-announcement, this is also the start of a broader and deeper services narrative - one that comes against a 900MM+ iPhone installed base, ~600MM of which don’t pay a dime in services,” Arcuri wrote.Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said Services is the key to the next five years of Apple growth.“We still believe Apple is likely to bundle hardware/services and/or multiple services over time, with our September 2018 analysis suggesting Apple could generate $22-37B in revenue by 2025 for an Apple Media bundle alone, up from $3.8B in 2018,” Huberty wrote.No Immediate ImpactCowen analyst Krish Sankar said Wall Street will likely get more bullish on the new services as the details trickle out in coming months.“We continue to view Services as a LT investable theme and the 3/25 event that introduced the upcoming Apple News+, Arcade, and TV+ subscription offerings suggest a differentiated but gradual approach to establishing future growth vectors,” Sankar wrote.Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster said Apple’s new batch of services will add $20 billion in revenue annually by 2023.“While we are maintaining our estimate of $78B in Services revenue in 2023, the levers to achieving that number are more clear,” Munster wrote.Citi analyst Jim Suva said investors shouldn’t expect the launches to be a near-term catalyst for the stock because consumers are typically slow to adopt new offerings.“However, we do see the next catalyst as the upcoming company earnings and capital deployment,” Suva wrote.See Also: Apple Arcade Is The Company's Newest Subscription Gaming ServiceiPhone Sales In FocusGoldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall said the markets focus will likely now return to slowing iPhone sales.“Though all of these services are interesting from a platform churn point of view none seem likely on our calculations to materially impact EPS in the short term, with the possible exception of Apple Arcade pending pricing and service details,” Hall wrote.PiperJaffray analyst Michael Olson said high-margin, highly recurrive subscription Services revenue is Apple’s solution to stagnating iPhone sales.“We estimate TTM services revenue per active installed device grew 19% y/y in FY18 and Apple is layering on new services to drive strong growth of this metric for years to come,” Olson wrote.Raymond James analyst Chris Caso said the market will likely see the new services as bullish for Apple, but it’s unlikely they will have an impact on the company’s overall numbers anytime soon.“While details of News+ pricing vary slightly from our initial assumptions - and pricing for updated TV+ services was not provided - we maintain our view that Apple suffers from the law of large numbers, with limited opportunities to offset the longer-term moderation / decline in iPhone sales,” Caso wrote.Ratings And Price Targets

66,89,AAPL,Yields In Focus Again As 10-Year Falls Below 2.4%; Homebuilder Earnings Digested,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13432060,"The interest rate shuffle might continue today, with U.S. stocks apparently taking their cue from what’s going on in the Treasury market. A negative tone prevailed early as yields sank again.A few weeks ago, stocks and Treasuries were both marching upward in sync, which is a bit unusual. Now, things have reverted to a more typical scenario, with the two diverging. Early Wednesday, as Treasuries rose and yields fell back below 2.4% on the 10-year note, U.S. indices ticked lower amid more concern that the rate decline might indicate rough waters ahead for the economy.Some of the renewed focus on yields, when you get right down to it, might reflect the lack of other things to talk about this week. While there is some data out there, the earnings calendar is very light and the China tariff situation seems to have taken a back seat for now. As for Brexit, it’s looking so confusing right now that the market might not know what to make of it, so it’s not acting as a catalyst. The employment report next week followed by Financial sector earnings could be the market needs to get back to focusing more on fundamental discussions.An Eye on EarningsSpeaking of earnings, there’s a smattering of them Wednesday. Homebuilder Lennar Corporation LEN missed third-party consensus on both earnings per share and revenue as it looked like some of the soft housing numbers we’ve seen lately might have come home to roost. However, the company offered a ray of hope in noting that mortgage rates have fallen and home prices have moderated, both of which could help the new home market to “correct itself.”Meanwhile, KB Home KBH reported better-than-expected earnings after the close Tuesday, and its shares were up in pre-market trading. On the negative side, the homebuilder did say it saw fewer home sales in the quarter—with lower prices—and its revenue was down 7%, short of third-party estimates.More earnings are on tap after the close, highlighted by Lululemon Athletica Inc LULU. Shares of LULU are outpacing the S&P 500 (SPX) so far this year, and the company raised guidance a couple of months ago.Earnings estimates for Q1 continue to look pretty soft. As of Monday, research firm CFRA predicts S&P 500 Q1 earnings will fall 2.3% year-over-year, with seven out of 11 sectors in the red. This would be the first year-over-year earnings decline since the 2015-16 “earnings recession” when earnings fell year-over-year four quarters in a row On the data side, the only major number coming out today is the weekly U.S. crude stockpiles report. Last week saw a much bigger than expected draw of nearly 10 million barrels, and supplies are below the five-year average. U.S. crude prices hovered just under $60 a barrel early Wednesday, near four-month highs. Another big crude draw might indicate continued strength in the economy, though keep in mind that we’re heading into what’s seasonally a strong time for crude demand.U.S. markets have been on a bit of a roller coaster over the last week amid all the rate worries, but remain solidly higher for the year as we near the end of Q1. At the end of trading Tuesday, the SPX was up 12.4% year-to-date, and the Nasdaq (COMP) was doing even better with nearly 16% gains. The small-cap Russell 2000 (RUT), which has been lagging the SPX lately, out-performed it Tuesday with 1% gains.Recovery TuesdayTuesday’s rally looked broad and pretty convincing, with all S&P 500 sectors finishing in the green. Even Financials, which had struggled the last week amid worries about falling rates and what they might say about the economy, joined in the cheer. Financials—which seemed to take their cue from the stabilizing rates—were among the best performers of the day, rising more than 1%. Another star was Energy, also up more than 1% as crude oil prices jumped back to $60 a barrel amid expectations for falling U.S. inventories.While cyclical sectors like Info Tech, Materials, and Industrials were also on the day’s leaderboard, the so-called “defensive” sectors like Utilities and Health Care also registered solid days, with Health Care getting a lift from strength in the biotech sector. Biotech had slumped over the last month following a hot start to 2019, and is typically a sector that does well when investors feel optimistic about the economy.The strength on the defensive side of the field also could be seen in the Treasury market, where 10-year yields stayed near recent low levels just above 2.4%, down from around 2.7% at the start of the year and 3.2% at the end of last summer. The Fed’s meeting last week with no more rate hikes apparently in the works for 2019 continues to pull the market in two directions. On the one hand, companies and the economy in general don’t appear to face the threat of higher rates, but on the other, the Fed’s dovish stance raises concerns about the health of U.S. and world economies. The 10-year fell below 2.4% early Wednesday and is now back below where it was at the start of last year.Data Don’t Send Positive SignalMore data poured in Tuesday, and it generally didn’t look too promising. February housing starts and building permits fell short of Wall Street analysts’ estimates, with housing starts sliding nearly 9% from a month earlier and single-family starts looking particularly weak. The housing market has generally been soft, but there are some hopes among economists that recent cheaper mortgage rates might give the sector a kick start. Home builder stocks traded mostly lower Tuesday on the fresh data, which didn’t offer much evidence of improvement.The other data Tuesday was March consumer confidence, and it also came up shy of estimates and below the February number. Consumer confidence has now declined in five of the last six months, Briefing.com noted. However, there are plenty of signs of consumer health, too. It’s possible the weak data might have played a role in the market’s stepping back from sharp early gains Tuesday. Another factor could have been Apple Inc AAPL shares reversing from green to red after Bloomberg reported that a U.S. trade judge ruled against AAPL and for Qualcomm, Inc. QCOM in a patent case. The judge recommended that some imported AAPL iPhones should be blocked from the U.S. as a result. AAPL got an apparent lift early Wednesday when the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled against an import ban, media outlets reported.VIX Settling Back DownVolatility, which came roaring back last Friday, has spent the last two days retreating. By the end of the day Tuesday, the VIX was back below 15 after a jump to above 17 last week. While VIX seems to be hibernating a little for now, the quick rise on Friday could indicate a bit of jumpiness in the market. That means the turbulence may not be over yet, and could resurface if, for instance, some unexpected news comes in. Remember, U.S. and Chinese negotiators were meeting this week on trade, so it might be prudent to keep an ear open for any headlines or tweets that might come out of that.Also, it might be worth considering that Friday is the last trading day of the quarter. Sometimes the quarter’s end is marked by some “window dressing” as fund managers shift positions before sending out quarterly statements. Investors might want to consider taking extra care in any moves they make this week because sometimes volume can pick up at times like these.UP FOR AIR: After a sharp descent since mid-month, Financials (candlestick) finally had an up day Tuesday. That might have had something to with stabilizing 10-year Treasury yields (purple line), though they remain down significantly over the last few weeks. Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices, Cboe.  Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.GDP To Pay a Call: Thursday morning brings the government’s second estimate of Q4 gross domestic product, and analyst estimates going into the data are for a slight downward course. The Briefing.com consensus stands at 2.5%, down a tick from 2.6% last time out. Beyond the headline number, investors might want to also focus on the updated government estimate for consumer spending during Q4, which last came in at a 2.8% rise. That was down from well above 3% the previous two quarters, but still relatively strong in a category closely watched for signs of consumer health. The real question might be what personal spending (and GDP) ended up being in Q1, which closes out at the end of this week. We won’t find out until late last month, but the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow indicator for Q1 rose to 1.3% on Tuesday, up from the previous 1.2%. The 1.3% is roughly in line with many economists’ estimates, and would be the lowest quarterly GDP growth since 2015.Minding All the Gaps: Lost in the shuffle this week amid all the focus on inversion in the Treasury complex is that the gaps between a number of key Treasury yields have been stable or actually getting wider. While the three-month Treasury yield continued to hold about a four-basis point premium to the 10-year yield Tuesday, the spread between the two-year and 10-year yields widened to 15 basis points, up from single digits at its low. In addition, the spread between 10-year and 30-year yields has been pretty stable recently and is wider than it was at the start of the month. Some analysts who look back at the historic data say the three-month to 10-year inversion, at least in the past, hasn’t signaled imminent pain for the stock market, though you never can bet on history repeating. A more dramatic inversion in some of the longer-term yields might be more substantive, but at this point that hasn’t come too close to happening. A Little M&A With Those Fries?: In M&A news, McDonald’s Corporation MCD turned away momentarily from its focus on food to announce a planned $300 million purchase of Dynamic Yield Ltd., a digital start-up company that MCD says can help it improve its drive-through technology. This purchase could be seen as a sign of the times, because it reinforces the importance of technology across all aspects of the economy. Also on the M&A front this week, Uber Technologies announced it will acquire Middle East rival Careem Networks for $3.1 billion. Uber plans to have its IPO next month.That’s two interesting M&A announcements this week alone, but M&A activity got off to a relatively slow start this year, according to Axios. Through roughly the first two months of 2019, M&A was well below the same pace a year ago despite a couple of major deals including Bristol-Myers Squibb’s BMY acquisition of Celgene Corporation CELG, a $74 billion deal. This year has a lot to live up to if it’s going to keep pace with last year’s historically strong M&A levels.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

67,90,AAPL,"Apple Wins One Patent Victory Against Qualcomm, Sees Adverse Ruling In Another Case",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13431829,"U.S. International Trade Commission members said in a Tuesday ruling that Apple Inc. AAPL did not violate a patent controlled by Qualcomm, Inc. QCOM.What HappenedQualcomm argued in a case brought forward to the ITC in 2017 that Apple violated its patents related to techniques to extending battery life on its phones and handling data efficiently, The Wall Street Journal reported.The court's ruling in Apple's favor is notable, as it overrules a prior ruling in September that said Apple violated a Qualcomm patent.In a separate ruling Tuesday, an ITC judge said in initial comments that an import ban of certain iPhone devices made in China will be recommended, according to WSJ. The decision is not final and the initial comments will be discussed by a six-member ITC panel that has one open slot.Why It's ImportantThe long-lasting legal feud between the two companies culminated in a decision which may sound ""most concerning"" to investors but in reality is mostly ""noise,"" Loup Ventures' Gene Munster told Bloomberg TV.""We are going to see some varying degrees of announcements both for Qualcomm and for Apple, but that doesn't change the trajectory of where the relationship between Apple and Qualcomm is going,"" the tech venture capitalist said. ""And that relationship is moving in a direction where they will eventually be separate."" What's NextTuesday's decision also marks an ""irritation"" for Apple, but the iPhone maker could take it as an opportunity to accelerate its move to become independent of Qualcomm, Munster said. Apple shares were trading 1.53-percent higher at $189.64 at the time of publication Wednesday, while Qualcomm shares were down 1.74 percent at $56.99. Related Links:Sell-Side Stays On Sidelines With Qualcomm, Awaits Resolution Of Licensing DisputesKerrisdale: Qualcomm Ruling Could Cut 'Stock Price In Half'Photo courtesy of Qualcomm. ",2019-03-27

69,92,AAPL,China Strength Appears To Give Markets An Early Boost Despite Weak Retail Sales Data,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13459084,"Friday’s enthusiasm looks like it might spill over into the new week as the focus remains squarely on China.A surprisingly healthy reading from China’s manufacturing sector early Monday was the first positive data out of that country in a while. While this could be a sign that Beijing’s efforts to stimulate the economy might be working, it’s also important for investors to consider taking a breath. This is a good number, but we need to see more evidence that things are doing well. One data point isn’t a trend, and bonds don’t really appear to be moving much on the news.That said, the better Chinese data could conceivably provide market support today for some U.S. sectors with more exposure to China, like Info Tech, Materials, and Industrials. Hopes for progress when trade talks resume later this week also could be helpful, but again, a lot depends on how things go.Back on the home front, retail sales for February disappointed with a 0.2% drop. Analysts had expected a 0.3% rise, so this might raise concerns about the consumer. Retail sales have now come in flat or lower in three of the last four months. However, Treasury and stock prices didn’t appear to have much initial reaction to the news in trading before the opening bell.In corporate news early Monday, airline stocks were mostly higher in pre-market trading despite a technology outage that appeared to ground some flights before a fix was announced. Delays are still possible, media reports said. Anyone flying somewhere today might want to keep an eye on the situation.90’s FlashbackWhen you think back to 1998, what comes to mind (assuming you’re old enough to remember)? Maybe it’s the Clinton administration, or Michael Jordan’s last championship run.Whatever 1998 might remind you of, the Q1 we just had was the best for U.S. stocks since then, and that appears to have the market in much stronger shape than where it started the year just 12 weeks ago. While the S&P 500 Index (SPX) remains about 3% below its all-time high close from last fall, it’s up more than 13% between the end of December and the end of March, led by so-called “cyclical” sectors like Information Technology, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services.When you consider some reasons for the big Q1 comeback after the Q4 collapse, it could partly reflect continued consumer health, signs of progress in talks with China, and the Fed going dovish after raising rates four times last year. Some of the stocks that often lead momentum, like the FAANGs and chipmakers, regained some traction in Q1, and that might have helped the overall market. U.S. data during the quarter was mixed to good, but there’s been some slowing in both the U.S. and world economies that might bear watching. Analysts are looking for weak U.S. Q1 growth both in earnings and in overall gross domestic product (GDP). Last week’s yield curve inversion led to talk among some analysts about whether that might be one signal of a possible recession.So even though stocks are acting healthier, we’re not necessarily out of the woods yet as Q2 begins. That said, one could argue that despite the rally in Q1, stock values haven’t really gotten out of hand. Forward price-to-earnings (P/E) on the SPX finished Q1 at 16.3, below the five-year average of 16.4, according to FactSet. It’s well above the 10-year average forward P/E, but that’s arguably less relevant because it still includes 2009 when stocks reached historically low P/E levels.China Trade Talks Head to D.C.; IPO Market BlossomsA lot of last week’s optimism appeared to center around renewed hopes for a trade resolution with China, and some of the stocks with exposure to China’s market did pretty well on Friday, including Boeing Co BA and Caterpillar Inc CAT. The question is whether the negotiations in China last week made any true progress, as they already are taking longer than the administration had said back in November when the deadline was set at March 1. Trade talks continue in Washington this week.The latest vote of confidence in stocks might be the suddenly energetic initial public offering (IPO) market, which got another “Lyft” (pardon the pun) from the IPO of ride-hailing company Lyft Inc LYFT. Shares rose nearly 9% on their first trading day Friday. An active IPO market often can symbolize investor and business confidence in the market, because few companies want to go public if investors don’t seem confident.LYFT’s strong first day could end up being seen as good news for Uber, a competitor that’s also planning an IPO. That said, it’s important for investors not to get too caught up in IPO enthusiasm. It’s important to avoid confusing a product with a stock. Just because you enjoy using a product doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is a good buy, and this applies to IPOs in general, not to any specific one. The financials of a company ultimately are what really matter most.Another reason investors might want to take the IPO optimism in stride is some of the geopolitical concerns that still outweigh many other aspects of the financial world right now. Until there’s a trade deal between the U.S. and China, it potentially could be hard for the broader stock market to break out of its recent trading range. The SPX has been in a relatively narrow range between just under 2800 and 2850 over the last week or two. It might need a new positive catalyst to move higher. Earnings season starts in less than two weeks, but forecasts are for weaker results than a year ago, so it’s uncertain if corporate results can provide the jolt they have in recent quarters.March Payrolls Approach After February DisappointmentAnother possible piece of market-moving news in the near future is the March payrolls report, due this coming Friday before the open. Recall that the February report was a big disappointment with job growth of just 20,000. The March report might show whether that was a weather- and shutdown-related fluke or maybe something more serious. We’ll discuss analyst estimates for March job and payroll growth later this week.Retail sales and construction spending for February are both due this week, along with March auto sales data.Interest rates also might get their share of coverage in coming days, as they have for a while now in the absence of much geopolitical or earnings news. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield ticked up just slightly on Friday to finish above 2.4%. That’s lower than where it started the quarter at around 2.68%, but it was enough to move the yield just ahead of the three-month yield, ending the inversion at least for one day. There’s no guarantee, however, that rates won’t invert again in the future if investors remain worried about slowing U.S. and global economies. The yield inversion—the first since 2007—was probably one reason the market got beaten down a week ago before clawing back by Friday.Brexit Countdown Begins Again: It’s never easy to directly chalk up a move in the stock market to a specific event, but it might not be just a coincidence that stocks pulled back from early gains Friday just about the same time as news hit about the U.K. Parliament rejecting Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit agreement for the third time. The S&P 500 Index (SPX), which had been up about 0.5%, suddenly lost most of those gains, though it did bounce back pretty quickly. As April begins, there’s less than a two-week countdown for the U.K. ahead of an April 12 deadline. Either the European Union accepts another delay in Brexit at that point, or the U.K. could face a potentially messy “no-deal” Brexit. So far this year, it’s hard to argue that Brexit worries have had a big impact on European stocks, which rose about 12% in the Q1. Nor has it seemed to be a major factor for the U.S. market. Still, the SPX’s sudden but short-lived downturn following Friday’s news might represent a preview of possible shakiness if things don’t get resolved by that April 12 deadline. The European Commission said Friday it expects a no-deal Brexit. Stay tuned.Sector by Sector with Brexit: Which sectors might be helped or hurt by a no-deal Brexit? It’s hard to think of any that would be helped too much, except possibly for banks. Some U.S. banks might benefit if they draw business away from U.K. banks facing economic uncertainty. That might be possible, but some analysts say uncertainty in European financial markets could also hurt U.S. banks. Many U.S. multinationals with exposure to the European economy could face possible issues if Brexit turns into a mess later this month. Some of the biggest U.S. exports to Europe include products like agricultural commodities, chemicals, aircraft, and pharmaceuticals. That means companies in Materials, Health Care, and Industrials all could see an impact. There’s also a big services trade, with intellectual property one of the key U.S. exports across the Atlantic. This could be an issue for companies in Info Tech like Apple Inc AAPL, Microsoft Corporation MSFT or some of the chip makers.Q1 Index Watch: While the SPX rolled out to big Q1 gains (the best quarter for the index since 2009), other indices performed even better. The Nasdaq Composite (COMP) ran up gains of better than 16% in Q1, and the Russell 2000 Index (RUT) of small caps climbed 14%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI), burdened in part by weakness in Boeing, had just 11% gains in the quarter. Info Tech, which got taken out to the woodshed in Q4, led all S&P 500 sectors in Q1 with better than 18% gains, while Financials, Materials, and Utilities all ended up near the bottom of the sector board for the quarter.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

70,94,AAPL,Starting Gun: Earnings Season To Start With Banks Amid Rate Worries,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13470201,"With Financial sector earnings season looming, a shot got fired across the bow last week when Tim Sloan, CEO of Wells Fargo & Co WFC announced his retirement. This unexpected move created some drama in a sector where it’s mainly been an interest rate game for the last year.Sloan’s retirement, which follows the company’s 2016 fake account scandal, received applause from some industry analysts who said a new CEO could help the bank’s reputation. However, a new CEO for Wells Fargo won’t necessarily be enough to help lift what’s been a lagging Financial sector in the face of a dovish Federal Reserve and a slowing economy. The sector did rally early in April when Treasury yields ticked higher, but still faces challenges.Big bank executives typically have the ear of many investors when they step up to the earnings plate and deliver their views of the latest economic developments and where they think things are headed both for the industry and the world outlook as a whole. Their words might get an even closer watch this time around, especially with rates tumbling and divisive issues like Brexit and China trade still in the headlines.Defensive Unit on FieldBanks enter Q1 earnings season playing a bit of defense, and the sector really hasn’t been all that strong for the last year. The big boost some analysts had expected for banks from last year’s rise in rates never really came, and meanwhile U.S. and overseas economies appear to be slowing, which could hurt banks’ ability to generate loans and suppress trading activity, another source of income for many big banks.The Fed’s about-face on policy in Q1 with its forecast that it’s not likely to raise rates again this year—abruptly halting five straight quarters of rate hikes—put pressure on bank stocks in Q1. The S&P Financial Select Sector Index (IXM) fell more than 6% from its March high in the days after the Fed announcement, losing much of its Q1 recovery. Financial stocks had been edging upward since getting beaten up in  Q4, and the pace accelerated on the first day of April. The sector is now up more than 10% year-to-date. However, that lags the S&P 500 Index (SPX), and it’s been a rocky road for the sector. (See figure 1 below.) Smaller regional bank stocks, in particular, appear to be taking a hit from the interest rate situation, as they have more exposure to interest rates. This so-called “second tier” of bank stocks, however, might get some interest from investors if China tariff talks start to look rocky, because they might be shielded more from overseas dangers.  However, they are also the most susceptible to continued lower rates.FIGURE 1: DOVISH FED PRESSURES BANK STOCKS. After falling along with the broader market at the end of 2018, the S&P Financial Select Sector Index (IXM – candlestick) rebounded quickly, but fell again after dovish comments from the Federal Reserve. Since then the sector has lagged the S&P 500 Index (SPX – purple line). Data source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.The five biggest bank stocks fell in the mid-to-high single digits after the Fed’s March meeting. Remember that bank financials have a strong arbitrage relationship with interest rates. When rates rise, it often encourages consumers and businesses to deposit money in their bank accounts to collect the interest. The banks then take those funds, lend them out at higher interest rates, and potentially can ring up profits.With the Fed’s decision to hold off further elevating rates in the near-term, that puts pressure on bank margins—and, consequently, their bottom lines.Possibly more troubling for banks is that the Fed noted that consumers and businesses were putting the brakes on spending. “Growth of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter,” the Fed said. “Recent indicators point to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter...overall inflation has declined.”The financial technology space might be a bright spot. Mobile payments are past the point of novelties as more and more consumers adopt the technology to cover costs on everything from beers with friends to bigger retail and household purchases. And it’s not just Millennials who no longer carry cash. Analysts are widely expecting companies in the mobile payments space to turn in strong results.One interesting development along those lines came with Apple Inc's AAPL announcement last week that it’s teaming with Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS on a credit card. It’s the first credit card for GS, and a sign of technology companies and banks working together on business ventures that could potentially benefit both.The Flattening Yield CurveYield curve inversion appears to be all the rage now as market pundits speculate on what it means when the 10-year Treasury rate falls below the three-month Treasury rate.When that happens—as we’ve seen in recent weeks—short-term interest rates lie at or just above long-term rates, typically an indication that investors believe that growth will be weak, which the Fed mentioned.And if the mortgage market is any indication, it might be a good idea to keep tabs on rates for home loans and pay close attention to what bank executives think about that impact on their bottom lines. Mortgage rates tumbled last week to their lowest level in 14 months and saw the biggest weekly point slide since 2009. Flattening yield curves have historically foreshadowed a recession ahead, according to researchers at the San Francisco Federal Reserve, who note that an inversion has preceded the last seven downturns. Given that, it will be interesting to hear what bank executives have to say in their forecasts.Two important points: A recession is a part of a normal business cycle, so one will eventually come. However, historically, no one has had too much luck predicting recessions, and the Fed still sees 2.1% U.S. economic growth this year. That said, are banks starting to see a slowdown in lending? What do they see ahead on the mortgage-lending front? Lower interest rates might typically spur home buying, but the tight inventory on housing might still be a deterrent. These are among the questions that might get answered during Financial earnings season.Also, investors might want to consider listening for bank executives’ views on Brexit and its possible impact. The latest Brexit deadline is now April 12, and it looks more and more likely that a “no-deal” Brexit might be in the works. Remember, London is a world banking capital. What happens to the banking sector worldwide and in the U.S. if there’s a mess in the U.K.? Perhaps bank executives can give some insight. The China tariff situation also remains fluid, so they might be asked to address that as well.On the more positive side, the initial public offering (IPO) market has picked up lately, which may be a source of profit for many of the big banks.Getting back to where we started, with the Wells Fargo & Co WFC CEO question, shares of WFC ended up pulling back Friday from a strong start as a little concern appeared to filter in on the news. One analyst noted that banks often groom their CEOs from within, but WFC has said it wants to hire from outside. That might be causing worry among some investors about the company’s future course, because hiring from outside might add a bit of mystery to where the business is headed.Q1 Earnings SeasonThough overall Q1 earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to fall more than 2% year-over-year, the Financial sector is one of the few that might see earnings growth in Q1.Financial sector Q1 earnings are seen growing 1.6% in Q1 year-over-year, CFRA said. That’s a pretty hefty slowdown from 17.1% in Q4, but also could reflect tougher year-over-year comparisons. For the full year 2019, CFRA sees Financial earnings rebounding and climbing more than 8%.Upcoming Earnings DatesJPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM and Wells Fargo & Co WFC are expected to report before the session begins on Friday, April 12.Citigroup Inc C said it will report before the market opens on Monday, April 15Bank of America Corp BAC, Morgan Stanley MS, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS are all expected to report earnings the week of April 15.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

71,96,AAPL,Market Seeks Direction As Investors Await Host Of Key Developments,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13508433,"Markets are on the cusp of a lot of news, but none has broken yet. This week brings a Brexit deadline, a European Central Bank (ECB) meeting, Fed minutes, and the start of earnings season, but for now, that’s all in the future and stocks don’t appear to be moving too far one way or another.The ECB meeting and Fed minutes are Wednesday, while earnings season begins in earnest on Friday. In the meantime, stocks might chop around a bit looking for direction in continued low-volume trading (see more below). Last Friday’s strong U.S. jobs report appeared to spark some buying that day, but the firmness didn’t really carry through into the new week.Brexit is another thing that’s out there, but it’s had a limited impact on U.S. stocks recently, maybe in part because people tend to be more focused on the China tariff situation. China trade is still the number one issue, even if there aren’t any new headlines about it. The U.K. is asking for another delay on Brexit, and if the European Union says no, that could potentially bring some volatility back to the U.S. markets as investors look at possible ramifications. The current Brexit deadline is Friday.Adding to the list of stuff to watch across the Atlantic is a renewed tiff between the U.S. and E.U. over tariffs. Both sides are barking at each other this week as the U.S. considers new tariffs, and that’s not necessarily helpful when you consider all the trade between them. If things get more tense, it could conceivably have an impact on some of the multinational U.S. companies that sell lots of product in Europe. These include pharma, agriculture, machinery, and aircraft makers. There’s also a big intellectual property trade.Slow GoIf there’s something the market’s had trouble scrounging up lately, it’s volume. Even during last week’s solid rally, trading was light, and sometimes a rally amid light volume might raise questions about just how much conviction the rally holds.Slow trading continued Monday as the new week began, even with catalysts like Friday’s jobs report, initial public offerings (IPOs) hitting the market, and the excitement of earnings season just ahead. We’ll have to wait and see if things pick up once earnings season begins in earnest with the big banks reporting this Friday.If last week’s jobs data didn’t push volume much higher, it seems unlikely that any of this week’s less impactful data would do the trick. Today is pretty light on the data calendar, with February job openings the only number that might get more than a glance. Inflation data tomorrow (see more below) could be something that gets a closer look.Some Investors Flee FAANGsMonday did bring some news in the form of the Investor Movement Index® (IMXSM). The IMX measures what TD Ameritrade clients are actually doing and their exposure level to markets. TD Ameritrade clients increased exposure to equity markets during the March IMX period, with the IMX increasing to 4.65, up 1.31% from the previous period. Some of the stocks that saw investor interest included electric car and cannabis companies.What’s interesting about IMX last month is that it showed retail investors selling shares of Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Facebook, Inc. FB, Netflix, Inc. NFLX, and Apple Inc. AAPL. That’s four of the five “FAANGs.” The Amazon selling was especially notable, because clients had been buyers of Amazon for eight straight months while also showing immense interest in NFLX in recent periods.A lot of the momentum in the market over the last few years has come from the FAANGs, so the question might be, if they were the momentum stocks, where will the new momentum come from? None of the FAANGs have made it back to their recent highs, which might call into question whether they can regain all the mojo they had a year ago.Some think semiconductors could make up for part of the lost FAANG enthusiasm, but semis had kind of a mixed day Monday. Some went up, others went down. It was just one session, however, and the whole sector has been on a roll lately.The stock that had been on a roll until Monday was Boeing Co BA, which fell 4% and basically took the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) along with it. By this point, there’s really no mystery about what’s ailing BA, but an analyst downgrade might have clipped the stock’s wings after it mounted a comeback last week from recent lows. The company reports earnings later this month, and at that point maybe investors can get more insight into BA’s long-term plans around its embattled 737 MAX program. BA said last week it’s temporarily cutting production of the plane by 20% as it deals with issues surrounding two fatal crashes.Crude CapersOne thing to consider watching is the creeping price of crude, now above $64 a barrel in the U.S. Prices have been climbing steadily most of the year, but got new energy Monday amid concerns about violence in Libya and how that might affect supply. OPEC is keeping a tight lid on production as it tries to soak up excess stockpiles, but U.S. rig counts have started to rise lately. High prices often tend to encourage U.S. production, and it’s worth wondering how long OPEC can remain disciplined if crude is going for more than $70 in Europe, as it currently is.The other thing to wonder is whether $3 a gallon gas in many U.S. cities might be enough to have consumers get worried about costs and start to hurt transport companies. If investors are worried about high gas prices’ impact on transports, it isn’t showing in the Dow Jones Transportation Average ($DJT). That index is up sharply over the last month and managed slight gains Monday.Speaking of sectors, leaders in the sector race Monday included Energy (not surprisingly considering the crude rally), along with Info Tech, Consumer Staples, and Consumer Discretionary. The BA weakness helped put pressure on Industrials, and so, apparently, did an analyst downgrade of General Electric Company GE.Two arguably positive factors Monday were Treasuries and the dollar, which both fell. Yields crawled up to 2.52% for the 10-year Treasury by the end of the day, and the dollar eased a bit.New Traction for Transports: Despite rising crude and gasoline prices, the Dow Jones Transportation Average (candlestick) has executed a sharp u-turn from last month’s weakness, as this chart shows. Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 Index (purple line) of small-caps is also moving higher, but bank earnings in coming weeks could pose a test for the index, which has a heavy exposure to banks. Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices, FTSE Russell. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Careful Approach?: Past isn’t always prologue, but if recent market action is any guide at all, the road to new highs for the S&P 500 Index (SPX) might not be linear. The most recent times the SPX pushed toward key psychological levels, it tended to chop around a bit as it came near. For instance, in February it  jumped back and forth as it negotiated a new challenge to the 200-day moving average for the first time in several months. The climb toward 2800 also had its slips and slides along the way, including a week back in early March when the SPX and the two other major U.S. indices all recorded lower closes every single day. Back on Sept. 20, the SPX posted an all-time intraday high just above 2940 after closing the previous session at an all-time high settlement just above 2930. As of six months later, both of those remain all-time intraday and closing peaks. The first psychological test for the SPX, if it’s going to re-challenge those summits, is 2900, and Monday’s failure to really test the 2900 level could be a sign of investor hesitation to chase things much higher for now. Last Friday’s better than expected jobs report, however, could be a helpful catalyst for bulls as the week advances. After Jobs Data Impress, Factory Orders Slump: The bearish counterpoint to last week’s jobs report, however, might be Monday’s factory orders report for February. The number fell 0.5% from the previous month, not far from the negative 0.6% Briefing.com estimate. Also, the government downwardly revised January’s figure to a flat performance. We’ve been talking for awhile now about the soft business investment environment, and this report might offer more evidence of that. However, it’s not the best idea to directly compare the weak factory orders to the strong jobs data, because the jobs data were for March and the factory orders were for February, when winter weather and the government shutdown were still front and center. When more March data starts working its way in, it might be interesting to see if it shows signs of a spark the way jobs did.Inflation Expectations Still Subdued: Later this week, the key economic reports look like they’ll probably be tomorrow’s consumer price index (CPI), Thursday’s producer price index (PPI), and Friday’s Michigan sentiment report. For March CPI tomorrow, Briefing.com consensus stands at 0.3%, up from 0.2% in February. Investors might want to keep a closer eye on year-over-year CPI, which was hardly even noticeable at 1.5% overall in February and 2.1% for core CPI. The Fed has pledged patience with rates, and inflation has generally stayed at or below the central bank’s 2% goal. It would likely take a surprisingly high number tomorrow to get anyone worried about the Fed, and even if the number did come in high, it might be marked off as an anomaly. No one month is ever a trend.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

72,97,AAPL,Info Tech Reporting Season Ahead: High Hopes Despite Signs Of Negative Q1 Earnings,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13508866,"The way Info Tech stocks outperformed the market over the last three months, investors might be expecting the sector’s Q1 earnings growth to be sky high. That won’t necessarily be the case, however, if analysts have things pegged right.Info Tech firms, on average, could see a slight-to-moderate year-over-year earnings decline, depending on which research firm you consult. Many reasons come to mind, including slowing sales in parts of the semiconductor chip sub-sector, a bit slower (though still strong) growth in cloud computing amid increasing competition, and weaker iPhone performance from Apple Inc. AAPL. Info Tech firms also enter Q1 earnings season facing some of the same issues as other S&P 500 sectors, including tough comparisons to year-ago performance, as well as a stronger dollar and a declining boost from the late 2017 U.S. tax reform that gave many companies a big spark in early 2018.A couple of companies reporting in March set the stage. Oracle and HP Inc HPQ appeared to disappoint investors, at least judging from their stocks’ reaction to earnings and guidance from the two firms. The Info Tech reporting seasons kicks off in a major way the week of April 22 (see more below).China Exposure Could Be CriticalLike a lot of sectors, Info Tech has a wide exposure to the Chinese market, so it wouldn’t be surprising if some companies saw an impact from the U.S./China trade battle and China’s slowing economic growth in Q1. It might be interesting to hear what some key executives like Tim Cook of AAPL and Satya Nadella of Microsoft have to say in their conference calls about any impact the trade situation is having on sales and projections.Apple—still the elephant in the room when it comes to Info Tech—already shook things up ahead of earnings season with reports that the company cut iPhone prices in China as it faces fierce competition and falling demand for its iconic product there. Many analysts see AAPL transitioning to a more service-oriented model, and the company’s announcement late last month about new streaming products like Apple TV+ might have helped shares. Apple has been one of Wall Street’s better performers in Q1, but shares are still a long way from the all-time highs posted last fall.The venerable AAPL wasn’t the only Info Tech company whose shares were living large in Q1 after a disappointing 2018. It’s shades of 2017 so far this year, as Info Tech led all sectors with blistering 22% gains through late last week, compared to around 14% for the S&P 500 (SPX). The Fed’s newfound dovish stance after a series of 2017 and 2018 rate hikes appears to have investors feeling optimistic about the stock market again, and when they feel that way they often gravitate toward Info Tech. Much of the sector’s strong showing in Q1 probably reflected a market that’s looking ahead, not behind. The stock market sometimes takes on the role of being a leading indicator, skating toward where investors think the puck is going to be rather than where it is now. There’s growing hope for earnings improvement in Info Tech and other sectors throughout 2019, and U.S. economic growth is also generally expected to improve as the year continues after a tepid Q1 performance, according to many analysts.The question now isn’t so much whether investors are enthusiastic or not about Tech, but more about whether demand for the industry’s widest-selling products can continue to justify the booming sector performance in Q2 and beyond. That likely means earnings season approaches with high investor expectations for Info Tech company guidance, meaning it’s possible companies that disappoint with their outlooks could get punished in the market.Chips Take New Leadership RoleTwo years ago, the so-called “FAANG” stocks, (which include AAPL), Alphabet Inc GOOG and several other Internet names, led Info Tech to better than 30% gains for 2017. However, most of the FAANGs got split off from Info Tech into the new Communication Services sector several quarters ago, so when people talk Tech now, it’s not about the FAANGs. Increasingly, the faces of Info Tech tend to be chip makers like Intel Corporation INTC and Micron Technology, Inc. MU, along with cloud-computing giants like Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Oracle Corporation ORCL.It looks like chips might have taken up FAANG’s former position as a market bellwether, providing momentum across the Info Tech sector and even into the rest of the S&P 500 when they look healthy, but spreading softness when they hit a road bump. Last fall, chip companies started warning of slower product growth, and that appeared to spook many investors. While there were many reasons for the Q4 Info Tech plunge, worries about declining chip demand can’t be overlooked. As Investor’s Business Daily noted in a recent article, semiconductors provide the ingredient technologies for personal computers, tablets, smartphones and other gadgets. They run communications networks and the Internet, and are underpinning so-called “smart” technology improvements to televisions, home appliances, automobiles and other devices. Trends like cloud computing, 5G wireless networks and artificial intelligence also depend on semiconductor chips. So arguably, if there’s a hitch in the semiconductor market, it could be a “canary in the coal mine” for much broader problems that go way beyond the semiconductor industry itself. Semiconductor stocks are up about 27% year-to-date, outpacing the Tech sector as a whole. It appears the market is hoping for a big pick-up in earnings growth and order demand for the chip sector of Info Tech in Q1, Briefing.com noted, adding that investors are likely to closely watch chip makers’ guidance to see if CEOs confirm the market’s assumptions that a cyclical bottom is taking shape.Current industry analysis suggests 2% to 3% growth in revenue this year and next for the chip industry. Memory chip sales are on pace to decline this year, while other segments should offset the shortfall, Investor’s Business Daily said.Q1 Earnings SeasonOn the whole, Q1 earnings for the Info Tech sector are expected to fall 1.1%, according to research firm CFRA. That makes Info Tech one of seven sectors where CFRA predicts a negative overall earnings performance in the quarter.FactSet is even more negative, expecting a 10.6% drop in Q1 Info Tech earnings performance, a much worse outcome than the 3% decline for the sector it had predicted back in late December. FactSet expects Info Tech revenue to fall 1% in Q1.It’s quite a change from 2018, when Info Tech earnings rose 23.9%, and from Q4, when they rose nearly 12%. For the full year of 2019, CFRA sees the sector’s earnings coming in flat, compared to a 2.2% projected rise for the full spectrum of S&P 500 earnings.However, as Briefing.com notes, a kind of broad-stroke thing to keep in mind with Tech is while earnings growth overall doesn’t look so swell for the sector, many individual companies have stronger earnings growth potential than in other blue chip areas. Arguably, the onus on companies whose shares had huge runs in Q1 is to live up to expectations that they can deliver even in a slower economy.Upcoming Earnings DatesThe Info Tech earnings season begins in earnest the week of April 22, when some of the companies Briefing.com projects to report include United Technologies Corporation UTX and Texas Instruments Incorporated TXN on April 23. Intel Corporation INTC and Microsoft Corporation MSFT are expected to report the same week.Apple says it will be presenting its fiscal Q2 results on Tuesday, April 30, after the close. Some of the key chip makers won’t be reporting until mid-May or June.Image sourced from Pixabay",2019-04-09
73,98,AAPL,Investor Movement Index March Summary,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13509422,"TD Ameritrade clients increased exposure to equity markets during the March IMX period, with the IMX increasing to 4.65, up 1.31% from the previous period.TD Ameritrade clients were once again net buyers during the March period.

BABA, and Twitter Inc. TWTR.Inclusion of specific security names in this commentary does not constitute a recommendation from TD Ameritrade to buy, sell, or hold.Historical OverviewTD Ameritrade's Investor Movement Index (IMX) has generally correlated with the S&P 500 as clients react to equity price movements, but the index has gone through uncorrelated periods. Beginning in January 2010, when TD Ameritrade started tracking the IMX, the index rose with equity markets until April 2010, when it peaked at 5.40. In May 2010 investors experienced the ""Flash Crash"" and the IMX began a sharp downward trend. The IMX didn't reach 5.00 again until the S&P 500 was well above April 2010 levels. The index eventually peaked at 5.56 in June 2011. This peak was immediately followed by a plunge in equity markets, and in the IMX, as the media was dominated by the U.S. debt ceiling debate, S&P downgrade of U.S. debt, and European debt concerns. The S&P 500 began to recover in the fall of 2011, but the IMX continued to decline until it reached a new low at the time in January 2012. As the S&P 500 began to sustain an upward trend in early 2012, the IMX started to rise. In 2013, as economic conditions improved and the S&P 500 climbed to record levels, the IMX rose to the high end of its historical range, finishing 2013 at 5.62, and continued to rise in 2014 amid geopolitical tensions related to Ukraine and the Middle East, until seeing slight declines in October and November. By the middle of 2015 the IMX had seen increases, as equity market volatility had reduced to near historical levels while the market continued its upward trend. As 2015 ended its third quarter, volatility had returned to markets, as global economic concerns and speculation around the timing and trajectory of Federal Reserve rate increases seemed to rattle overall equity markets. This uncertainty continued to play a role in the equity markets through the fourth quarter of 2015 and into early 2016. The volatility accompanying this uncertainty abated in the second quarter of 2016 and remained low until late in the third quarter. Just as it had in 2015, the IMX saw increases mid-year during the period of lower volatility. The IMX continued to climb into the fourth quarter reaching 5.83 in October 2016, its highest point in two years. A brief spike in volatility during November, timed around the U.S. presidential election, coincided with a slight pull back in the IMX, which then ended 2016 at the high end of its historical range. The IMX started 2017 with an upward trend and reaching an all-time high in March, before pausing in April as lower volatility lead to a decrease in the IMX. The momentum resumed in May, with the IMX breaching 7.0 for the first time ever in July of 2017. The IMX took another brief pause in September, before following markets higher and breaching 8.0 for the first time ever in November and ending 2017 at an all-time high. Volatility returned to the markets in early 2018, and the IMX decreased for four consecutive months to start the year. The IMX then rebounded in the spring of 2018, and continued higher during the summer on the back of better-than-expected earnings and increasing equity markets.

74,99,AAPL,March IMX Reveals Value Is Making A Comeback,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13510520,"Investors are still bullish coming out of the first quarter, but they’re prioritizing value over growth.That’s according to the March edition of the Investor Movement Index (IMX), TD Ameritrade’s monthly review of investor sentiment based on its clients’ portfolio activity, which climbed a modest 1.31 percent to 4.65.The Frugal InvestorTDA clients remained buyers of equity over the course of the month. While investors ended the quarter by expanding their equity exposure, however, the stocks they prioritized we’re generally trading at a steep discount.The auto segment was of particular interest to TDA clients in March, which kicked off with disappointing vehicle sales figures from February. There was also turmoil in the electric vehicle market, from Elon Musk announcing Tesla, Inc. TSLA likely won’t be profitable over Q1 to China cutting its national electric vehicle subsidy in half. The volatility from these headlines helped Ford Motor Company F, Tesla and Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO Inc. NIO make it into the portfolio of TDA clients over the course of the month.Other stocks highlighted as net buys over the month included a few names considered value stocks, including CVS Health Corp. CVS and Kraft Heinz Co. KHC, both of which started the month on disappointing 2019 guidance. AT&T Inc. T rounds out the list of slow growth names that attracted investors in March after the company announced its intent to restructure its WarnerMedia and Directv assets through a planned content streaming service.One standout among the most purchased stocks among TDA clients was Aurora Cannabis Inc. ACB. Neither a value name nor a safety investment, Aurora drew massive investor interest upon the announcement that Nelson Peltz would be joining the company as a strategic adviser. Aurora ended the month up more than 23 percent.Investors De-FANG Into EarningsAs you might expect, while investors were busy adding stocks trading at a coupon, they were also selling the stocks priced at a premium. This comes in approach to an earnings season most analysts expect will disappoint compared to what the Street has seen over recent reporting seasons.No stocks better exemplify that than the blue-chip tech stocks that make up FANG, which ended the quarter up anywhere from 10 percent to 30 percent. All four FANG stocks — Facebook, Inc. FB, Apple Inc. AAPL, Netflix Inc. NFLX and Google-parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG GOOGL — were net sold on the month.Other high valuation tech names like Twilio Inc. TWLO, which ended the quarter up 25 percent, Intel Corporation INTC and Twitter Inc. TWTR, which both ended the quarter up about 15 percent, were also among TDA clients’ net sold names.While the performance of these companies during the first three months of the year certainly warranted investors' profit taking, none of them matched the huge gains made by Chinese tech giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA. Although the stock experienced a more than 6-percent drop in March thanks to continued worries over the country’s economic strength, Alibaba still finished the first quarter up 35 percent.Click here to read the full IMX report.",2019-04-09
75,103,AAPL,Banks On Parade: Bank of America Becomes Latest Big Financial Company To Report,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13544788,"The bank earnings parade continues Tuesday, and this time Bank of America Corp BAC is in the spotlight. Later today, however, focus could shift to Netflix Inc. NFLX as it becomes the first “FAANG” sighting of the season.At the same time, major indices took on a positive tone early in the day amid what appeared to be more hopes of a U.S. tariff deal with China. That situation remains fluid as every little rumor draws attention. Today the rumors are positive and the market is looking stronger. Tomorrow it could be the opposite. For investors, it might go back to paying attention to earnings and listening for company outlooks.After some mixed bank results Monday from Citigroup Inc C and Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS, Bank of America kicked off the day by beating third-party consensus earnings per share estimates but coming up just shy in the revenue department. Earnings of $0.70 a share beat the $0.66 average analyst estimate, while revenue of $23 billion was slightly under the $23.33 billion that analysts had expected.Strength in BAC mostly appeared to come from the retail side. In its press release, BAC said “economic and consumer activity in the U.S. continue to be solid,” and that businesses of every size are borrowing. It called the capital markets environment “challenging,” however. Shares of the company gyrated around unchanged in pre-market trading.BAC’s positive comments about consumer activity and the U.S. economy offer more evidence of how healthy consumers are in the driver’s seat. You may not consider consumers as the major driving force behind bank earnings, but today they might have been.The healthy consumer also might have been one factor helping to give Johnson & Johnson JNJ a boost in Q1 as the company beat third-party consensus for both earnings and revenue. Shares rose in pre-market trading.BAC wasn’t the only big financial firm reporting Tuesday. BlackRock, Inc. BLK also surpassed analysts’ profit expectations while assets under management also climbed. Shares rose nearly 2% in pre-market trading.The last big bank to report will be Morgan Stanley MS, tomorrow morning. Before that, focus might turn to the Communication Services sector, where Netflix gets ready to share results after the close today. For NFLX, positive economic drivers have likely played a role in its recent performance. Last quarter, the company posted results that beat Street estimates for earnings and subscriber numbers, but fell a bit short on revenue. It offered guidance for Q1 that was more modest than third-party analysts expected.It’s a busy earnings afternoon, with Netflix, IBM IBM, CSX Corporation CSX, and United Continental Holdings UAL all unveiling their Q1 results after the close. Basically, that could give people a taste of how a bunch of different parts of the economy are coming along, and CEO comments, as they often are, could be worth listening to. NFLX is the first “FAANG” of the season, and it’s limping a little going into reporting day as investors assessed a new streaming threat from Walt Disney Co DIS. More on that below.Meanwhile, investors are steeling themselves for key data on retail sales and housing later this week, and the next Fed meeting isn’t far away, either, due at the end of the month.We’re still early in earnings season, but so far companies reporting have been roughly in line with the historic average as far as beating Wall Street’s expectations, FactSet reported.Financials Lose Ground To Start WeekThe takeaway from Monday might be, “it could have been worse.” After all, two big banks reported lower-than-expected Q1 revenue to start the day, and Financials stayed under pressure most of the session. However, major indices charged back to finish well off their lowsEarnings from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup were kind of a mixed picture despite revenue weakness. Both beat analysts’ expectations on earnings per share, but left some analysts wondering if they can find ways to pick up the pace as the year continues. Many face some growth challenges, including the Fed’s low interest rate policy and investors who’ve retreated a bit from trading the markets after last year’s Q4 washout.GS has made a move toward the consumer banking and is working hard to control costs. C, meanwhile, has been buying back shares and paying dividends to shareholders. The question might be whether this sort of activity can get investors excited about buying the stocks even as some industry fundamentals retreat. That’s something that only can be answered over time.The Tiger Effect?On the subject of time, it had been 14 years since Tiger Woods last won the Masters, but his victory over the weekend appeared to quickly have an impact on the athletic apparel sector as shares of Nike Inc NKE and Foot Locker, Inc FL both jumped Monday. That had some analysts talking about a possible “Masters bounce” for the industry.Another industry getting a bounce Monday was solid waste, where a bunch of stocks ticked higher following the biggest acquisition in a decade for the sector. Waste Management Inc.’s WM announcement that it’s buying Advanced Disposal Services Inc ADSW for $3 billion appeared to help both stocks clean up for their respective shareholders. Sometimes when there’s a big deal announced you see shares of the acquiring company take a dip, but that wasn’t the case Monday with WM, maybe in part because the company said the deal would be immediately accretive to cash flow and adjusted earnings. The deal expands WM’s footprint into certain Midwest states, The Wall Street Journal noted.Looking down from 30,000 feet, it wasn’t a really dramatic way for markets to start the week. Financials, Real Estate, and Energy were among the biggest market losers Monday, while Consumer Staples and Health Care led. For Health Care, that represented a turn-around after sharp losses last week as uncertainty about health policy swirled. One thing worth noting is how biotech stocks have diverged from other Health Care sub-sectors like insurers so far this year. Biotech has been pretty powerful, but Health Care is at the bottom of the sector leaderboard.One day is never a trend, but the way things shaped up Monday, it looked like investors moved into more cautious territory after the S&P 500 Index (SPX) climbed above 2900 Friday for the first time since last fall. Today and tomorrow it could be interesting to see if the cyclicals get their game back ahead of the long weekend, as the market is closed Friday for the Good Friday holiday. Volatility, which had been sinking to new lows for the year, dialed back up a bit, but did pull back from early session highs.If caution was the watchword in stocks Monday, it didn’t seem to extend much into the Treasury market. The 10-year yield was barely lower, ending the day right near 2.55%. This followed remarks early in the day by Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who said risks “from the downside” currently outweigh “upside” risks. He added he’d be happy to keep rates at their current level until the fall of 2020 if that helps inflation reach a sustainable level.Evans’ comments didn’t appear to have much influence on the U.S. Dollar Index, which was flat and finished a few points below 97. The dollar has been pretty range-bound recently but hasn’t retreated all that much from the year’s highs. That might be a sign of investors hanging on to something they see as a security blanket as overseas economic growth lags and trade talks continue with no end date in sight.Figure 1: FIRST FAANG: With Netflix the first FAANG scheduled to report after the close today, here’s a look at how FAANGs have performed since the start of the year. They’re up more than 20%, which is roughly even with the Nasdaq (COMP). However, weakness in NFLX over the last few days along with a brief halt in Apple’s upward progress have pressured FAANGs lately. Data Source: ICEChart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Slicing the Apple: Looking away from earnings for a moment, Apple Inc AAPL shares had a choppy time late last week and again Monday after getting upgraded by one analyst and downgraded by another. One school of thought says it’s good to see AAPL gaining market share in China, but the other theory is that market share gains are coming because AAPL had to cut prices, which could put the squeeze on its margins. AAPL shares briefly climbed above $200 a share Friday and have had a great year so far, but sometimes it feels like $200 could be a mental barrier for the stock. That looked like the case again Monday as shares pulled up just 15 cents short of the big round number. For the FAANGs in general, especially after NFLX’s weak performance Friday and more weakness Monday amid competitive worries, the question remains whether they can regain their mojo. None has gotten back to their old highs.Tariffs Hit Tokyo: It’s not just the U.S. and Europe’s economies remaining in kind of a holding pattern amid the U.S./China trade battle. Japan is also feeling the impact, Bank of Japan President Haruhiko Kuroda told CNBC in an interview over the weekend. He said Japan’s exporters are feeling some pain from lack of Chinese demand as the tariff negotiations go on. Info tech exports are among the Japanese products seeing  a negative impact, he added. The next BOJ meeting takes place next week, and Kuroda told reporters earlier this month that the BOJ has tools to loosen monetary policy further if needed. Japan’s inflation rate hasn’t hit the BOJ’s 2% target despite years of easing policy, and, as Reuters pointed out, that’s hurting savers in the country who face extremely low interest rates on their bank deposits. Financial institutions there are also under pressure due to the low rates.Why care about Japan’s economy if you’re a U.S. investor? Well, the U.S. exported $114 billion in goods to Japan in 2017, making the country our fourth-largest trading partner. The main U.S. exports include agricultural products, machinery, aircraft, and optical and medical instruments, according to the U.S. Trade Representative. This might help explain why a resolution to the China tariff situation could have such a wide impact on many industries.Stream Wars, Episode One: A New Entry: If there's one key takeaway from last week's announcement by The Walt Disney Company that it would be launching its own streaming service, it's that the mantra of iconic former CEO Michael Eisner still rings true today: ""Content rules."" The big news—namely that the Disney+ service will launch November 12, that the company would be pulling all of its content from streaming giant Netflix, and that its subscription price would undercut the competition, at least initially—sent shares of DIS up 10% and shares of NFLX down 3%. With all the content from its $71 billion asset acquisition from Twenty-First Century Fox, plus its 90-plus years of original content, DIS seems to be changing the rules of engagement regarding video streaming. When one considers that a handful of firms controls the vast majority of media content in the U.S., it's possible that, in the future, we could see media partitioned into a few behind-the-subscription-wall streaming services. This is certainly a trend worth watching.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

76,104,AAPL,Qualcomm Surges After Settling Apple Royalty Dispute,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13547147,"Apple Inc. AAPL and QUALCOMM, Inc. QCOM said Tuesday they've reached an agreement in a royalty dispute over computer chips, avoiding a trial that began this week in California.The agreement, which ends all litigation between the two tech companies, includes a payment of an undisclosed amount from Apple to Qualcomm. The companies said they also reached a six-year license agreement and a multiyear chip supply agreement.Why It's ImportantThe companies were starting a battle with billions of dollars at stake this week in federal court over the royalties that Qualcomm charges Apple for its chips, which allow Apple's iPhone, and other smartphones, to connect to mobile networks.Apple has accused the chipmaker of over-charging with its 5-percent royalty on iPhone sales saying Qualcomm is essentially profiting off Apple's innovation. Qualcomm counters that it holds the patents on the chips Apple needs.The agreement announced Tuesday covers all litigation, including legal action involving Apple's contract manufacturers. The disagreement between the two companies threatened the move for both into the new world of 5G internet connectivity.Price ActionShares of Qualcomm were up 20 percent to $68.70 after the news. Shares of Apple traded around $198.89.Meanwhile, Intel Corporation INTC dropped sharply, trading around $56.32 per share.Related Links:Apple, Qualcomm In Court: What You Need To KnowSell-Side Stays On Sidelines With Qualcomm, Awaits Resolution Of Licensing DisputesPhoto credit: Kārlis Dambrāns, Flickr",2019-04-16
77,105,AAPL,"Hot, Fresh Earnings On The Menu As Netflix, Morgan Stanley Results In Focus",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13552161,"Wall Street took on a slightly green tint early Wednesday as investors sorted through another bag of hot, fresh earnings. Morgan Stanley’s MS latest quarter got an early thumbs up from investors, but Netflix.com, Inc. NFLX appeared to get a thumbs down.Morgan Stanley became the latest big bank to report early Wednesday, and this time the news looked pretty good from the standpoint of beating expectations. One thing to consider, however, is that even though the company’s results outpaced third-party consensus estimates for both earnings and revenue, MS saw profit fall year-over-year and cited a slow Q1 trading environment. That matters because MS is a firm that’s taken the mantle on the trading business in recent quarters and relies more on trading than many of its competitors.Despite that, shares of MS jumped more than 2% in pre-market trading and potentially could help underpin Financials after Tuesday’s big gains for the sector.The earnings flow is going to slow down slightly toward the end of the week after this morning’s deluge that also included Abbott Laboratories ABT and PepsiCo, Inc. PEP. Tomorrow brings Phillip Morris and Union Pacific Corporation UNP, but then things tail off into Friday’s holiday. Next week looks like a big one, though, with Boeing Co BA and Microsoft Corporation MSFT among the highlights. BA’s earnings call next Wednesday could be one of the more anticipated ones of the season as many investors await more clarity on the 737 MAX situation.PEP earnings looked relatively strong and the stock got a lift in pre-market trading. The company’s snacking business carried the day with Frito-Lay sales growing more than 5% from a year ago.Chinese Fortunes ImproveIt was just one-tenth of a percentage point, but China’s gross domestic product (GDP) outdid expectations in Q1, rising 6.4%. Analysts had expected 6.3%, according to Trading Economics. Industrial production and retail sales also surpassed consensus estimates, so all of this might help lift some of the clouds that had hovered over China’s economic picture the last few months. Decent exports reported last week helped set the tone for Wednesday’s data.Still, Chinese stocks didn’t seem to get much juice out of the news, rising only slightly on Wednesday. One thing the data might also point to is that China’s economy seems to be rolling along in pretty decent shape despite U.S. tariffs, though it’s true that 6.4% growth is relatively low compared with much of the last decade. Does this have any implications for resolving the trade battle? We’ll have to wait and see.Netflix Preview DisappointsInvestors took an earnings double-whammy after the close Tuesday when both IBM IBM and Netflix slipped following their respective Q1 reports. Starting with NFLX, most of the Q1 numbers looked pretty good. NFLX beat third-party consensus on earnings and met revenue expectations, but investors appeared disappointed with the company’s guidance. Third-party consensus for Q2 had been $0.99 going into earnings, but NFLX forecast just $0.55. Its net subscriber guidance for Q2 also came in slightly below Wall Street’s expectations.As we’ve often seen with earnings lately, investors tend to punish companies that don’t deliver the kind of bullish guidance many analysts are looking for, and that appeared to be the case with NFLX. The soft guidance also might trigger some concerns about how the company might deal with so much new streaming competition in coming quarters. Also, it could raise questions about whether NFLX’s recent price increases could be slowing subscriber growth.NFLX shares fell sharply after Tuesday’s close but then bounced back to some relatively strong gains in pre-market trading. It appears maybe some investors are starting to look past the guidance and back toward what some analysts called a successful Q1 for the company. A bullish analyst report on NFLX from a major investment bank, along with several other positive Wall Street assessments, appear to be helping shares.IBM fell even more sharply, down 3%, after the close as investors digested a Q1 revenue miss. It marked the third quarter in a row of year-over-year revenue losses for the company. It’s also not too uplifting to see the company’s Cloud & Cognitive Software segment fall 1.5% in revenue year-over-year.Semis Applaud Apple DealAway from the hum of earnings, there was big news in the Info Tech sector Tuesday as Apple Inc. AAPL and Qualcomm, Inc. QCOM agreed to dismiss all litigation between the companies and reached a six-year licensing agreement. The two had been in a long legal battle about royalties related to smart-phone technology. Shares of QCOM jumped more than 17% following the news, while AAPL shares inched closer to $200. No terms were disclosed, The Wall Street Journal said.The dispute settlement seemed to lend support to other members of the semiconductor industry as well, with Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, Nvidia Corporation NVDA, and Micron Technology, Inc. MU all climbing. However, shares of Intel Corporation INTC didn’t initially join the party, which may reflect investor disappointment over possible lost hope for more business with AAPL.Semiconductor stocks hit a new high for the year Tuesday, and this might signal more than just excitement over the AAPL/QCOM agreement. Semiconductors are often seen as a leading indicator for economic growth, so strength in the sector might reflect investor confidence in economies around the world. Part of this could ride on higher hopes for a U.S./China trade deal, along with relief about the possible extension of Brexit into October.A dovish Fed also arguably plays a big role in the current rally, which has seen cyclical stocks like Info Tech lead the way. Headlines this week that more than one Fed member thinks the Fed can possibly be comfortable with slightly higher inflation could feed into this as well. The Fed’s favored inflation gauge—the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index—is currently at 1.8%, the lowest in around three years.It would likely take a major upside surprise in PCE prices to get markets worried much about the Fed at this point, analysts say, which might be one reason why the rise in Treasury yields this week hasn’t really seemed to slow down stocks too much. The 10-year yield rose to 2.6% on Tuesday for the first time in nearly a month, but it remains slightly lower than at the start of the year and well under highs of more than 3.2% last fall.More Industrial SoftnessIf investors were hoping March Industrial Production data would show a U.S. factory turn-around from recent weakness, they might have walked away disappointed Tuesday. The number fell 0.1% month-over-month, below the Briefing.com consensus for a 0.2% rise. On a year-over-year basis, manufacturing output fell 1.1% in Q1. This could play into weaker expectations for Q1 gross domestic product (GDP).Health Care stocks went in divergent directions Tuesday despite solid earnings from UnitedHealth Group Inc UNH and Johnson & Johnson JNJ. Shares of UNH fell 4% and are down sharply over the last week as worries grow that new laws under discussion in Washington, D.C., might hurt the health insurance sector. The company’s CEO spoke against “Medicare for all” in the UNH earnings conference call. He also said health care price inflation has been slowing.Looking ahead toward later this week, Thursday brings March housing starts and building permits, both of which are expected to rise slightly from a month earlier, according to Briefing.com consensus. The markets are closed Friday for the Good Friday holiday, so investors might want to consider being on the lookout for possible volatility ahead of the long weekend.Figure 1: SEMIS ON A TEAR: Semiconductor stocks rallied to new 2019 highs Tuesday, partly on hopes for economic strength but also amid news that Apple and Qualcomm had reached a settlement. Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Theme Party For Banks: There seems to be a theme developing with bank results so far. Most of the big banks appear to be struggling on the trading side, trying to cut costs, repurchasing shares, and doing pretty well on the bottom line but not so great on revenue. Like some of the other banks, Bank of America Corp BAC, which reported Tuesday, did a little better than some analysts had expected on net interest income thanks in part, possibly, to the Fed’s latest rate hike back in December. One question to consider about banks’ businesses looking ahead is a dichotomy in the rate picture. On the one hand, the yield curve—part of which went negative last month—is back into a position where it could be more favorable to bank profits. The other side of the story is that the Fed has basically said it plans to stand pat on yields throughout the year, a potential challenge for banks trying to grow their profit margins.“Resilient” Oil Demand, Including in China: U.S. crude prices are up about 50% since the lows near $42 posted around Christmas. Strong U.S. demand is one story, but perhaps a surprising development is hefty demand from China, too. This comes despite a number of data points indicating some slowness in the Chinese economy. Not on the energy demand front, however.“In China, the economy seems to be reacting to the government’s stimulus measures, with purchasing managers’ indices increasing and export orders recovering, although there are signs that air cargo volumes might be falling,” the International Energy Agency recently said. “Preliminary oil demand numbers for the January-February period show solid growth.” Also, oil market publication OilPrice.com recently quoted a commodities analyst at a major U.S. bank saying that oil demand is “solid” now in China. These developments might work against notions that falling oil demand points to problems in the world economy. On the contrary, OilPrice.com said, oil demand looks “resilient” even amid some slowness in economic growth.Big Spender?: As a young person starting out, it can be very tough to buildsavings habits early. A survey released early this year by TD Ameritrade onspending habits by generation shows that some millennials might be finding thatout the hard way. The survey showed average monthly spending onnon-essentials—including travel, gifts, and dining out—for most Americans is $697. However, the average for millennials is highest at $838 a month.Millennials also were most likely (49% of those surveyed) to say non-essentialspending affects their credit card debt.Even more worrisome is that 64% of millennials surveyed said spending on non-essentials has a negative impact on their retirement savings. As a young person, retirement can seem far, far away. While it’s not against the rules to have fun now and then, it's important to understand the power of compounding, and how it often works best if you get started as soon as possible. That might mean missing out on a few restaurant meals now and allowing some of that money to potentially go to work for you.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

78,106,AAPL,'Significant Win': Wall Street Weighs In On Qualcomm-Apple Deal,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13552178,"After years of legal disputes about patents and royalties, Apple, Inc. AAPL and QUALCOMM, Inc. QCOM finally reached an agreement on Tuesday. Apple agreed to pay Qualcomm an undisclosed amount of cash, and Qualcomm agreed to a chipset supply deal that presumably means Qualcomm will continue to supply Apple with iPhone chips.The market seems to see the agreement as a win-win for both companies. After spiking 20 percent Tuesday, Qualcomm shares jumped another 12 percent Wednesday morning.Several Wall Street analysts have weighed in on both stocks following the agreement. Here’s a sampling of what they’ve had to say.Overhang RemovedMorgan Stanley analyst James Faucette said Qualcomm is now free to refocus its attention on growing its business and expanding its ecosystem.“We think this settlement is a significant win for Qualcomm and results in a similar, if not better, outcome to a scenario we laid out in January, which would have been reached had Qualcomm achieved a win at the FTC,” Faucette wrote in a note.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said the abrupt end to the multi-year soap opera between Apple and Qualcomm completely blindsided Wall Street.“With a settlement there is no more uncertainty abound for either company and thus removes an overhang that has long weighed on both companies,” Ives wrote.Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth said the next major bullish catalyst for Qualcomm will be the global rollout of 5G wireless networks.“I believe further upside exists in the stock from current levels and continue to recommend purchase,” Feinseth wrote.Intel’s RoleMizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh said Intel Corporation INTC is the surprise loser from the agreement.“The Apple settlement ($5B+), 6- yr licensing, and INTC exit, places QCOM as the undisputed leader in 5G with little competition,” Rakesh wrote.KeyBanc analyst John Vinh said Intel dropping the ball on its 5G modem motivated Qualcomm to reach a deal with Apple.“We expect the 5G chip supply agreement and the resumption of ongoing licensing royalties to add ~$2.00 in EPS to our F2021 estimates for QCOM,” Vinh wrote.Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse said Intel losing the 5G war to Qualcomm will be a tough pill to swallow for Intel management.""As for laterals, we now look for Bob Swan at Intel to likely exit the modem business (clearly a focus on Intel’s conference call next week as well as Analyst Day in May),"" Muse wrote.Financial ImpactRaymond James analyst Chris Caso said Qualcomm now has a clear path to $7 in EPS.“From our current estimate of $4.66, we expect FY20 non-GAAP EPS could move above $6 (from licensing and lower legal costs), while for FY21, we expect EPS north of $7 including $0.50 from Apple chipsets, as well as flow-through of 5G chipsets to other OEMs, based on our belief QCOM will capture a large majority of the CY20 5G cycle as the competition appears so far behind,” Caso wrote.Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang said Qualcomm will now have 60 percent model market share for Apple devices as soon as the second half of 2019.“We think Apple will contribute $1.2 billion towards Qualcomm’s equipment and services revenue and $500-550 million of licensing fee revenue in the second half of CY2019,” Zhang wrote.JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee said Qualcomm should have about $12 of royalty revenue per iPhone moving forward.""Our math implies downside from recalibration of licensing rates with other OEMs is likely to be modest at most, while offering potential upside from capturing greater share of 5G chipset sales,"" Chatterjee wrote.Ratings And Price Targets

""They were nowhere to be found,"" Kalayjian said.See Also: Why The Bond King Says The Fed Needs To Stop Raising Interest RatesNow the central bank could be confronted with stagflation and the Fed doesn't know how to handle it, he said. ""I think 2023 is going to be a bloodbath in the equity markets ... so I wouldn't be long with your money here,"" Kalayjian said.Why It Matters: The SPDR S&P 500 SPY was volatile this week as investors focused on CPI data and the Fed's response. The market appears to have made up its mind — investors are retreating following the FOMC meeting. Mega-cap tech appears to be leading the charge lower, led by declines in Apple Inc AAPL and Alphabet Inc GOOG.The headline CPI increased 7.1% last month, down from 7.7% in October. The November CPI reading came in below average economist estimates of 7.3%, according to Benzinga Pro. The Fed opted for a less aggressive hike in response to the data, raising its target range for the federal funds rate by 0.5%. In a press conference following the decision, the Fed chair acknowledged that recent data is encouraging, but he indicated that it's not enough.""It will take substantially more evidence to get confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path,"" Powell said. Check This Out: Fed Still Needs 'Substantially More Evidence' Following 0.5% Rate Hike — Experts React With 'Famous Last Words'Kalayjian told Benzinga the Fed has no accountability.They sat on their hands and let inflation run before they took action, he said: ""Where were they at three and four percent?""Now Powell wants to ""ruin people's lives"" by cutting American jobs.

81,5969,WMT,This Week's Earnings Repertoire,https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/20/11/18578920/this-weeks-earnings-repertoire,"During the previous shortened week, COVID-19 outbreaks grew while vaccine developments provided a glimpse of hope of finally putting an end to COVID-19. This week, Zoom Video Communications, Inc. ZM, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD, DocuSign Inc DOCU, salesforce.com, inc. CRM, Five Below FIVE, and Kroger KR are set to deliver their earnings reports.ZoomThe question on everyone's mind is can Zoom maintain its growth momentum? On Monday afternoon, Wall Street expects Zoom to report earnings of 76 cents per share on revenue of $693.95 million. Just one year ago, Zoom delivered earnings of 9 cents per share on revenue of $166.59 million. The economy might have plunged during the coronavirus pandemic, but Zoom stock skyrocketed as its cloud-based video collaboration platform became the textbook definition of the work and study-at-home lifestyle. However, its stock fell 15% with positive coronavirus vaccine developments so investors will be watching churn rates to see the percentage of users who are cancelling their subscriptions.Crowd FundingSoftware stocks altogether have gone on a massive rally March and cybersecurity stocks were among the biggest winners as companies needed additional security for their home-office setting. CrowdStrike surged as much as 202% year to date, with 93% and 13% gains over six months and last thirty days, respectively. But CrowdStrike also needs to show it can maintain its strong growth when corporations decide to return to an office setting.Wall Street expects CrowdStrike to breakeven on revenue of $212.60 million. Exactly one year ago, it lost 7 cents per share while generating revenue of $125.12 million.DocuSignAfter close on Thursday, Wall Street expects the digital signature company to earn 13 cents per share on revenue of $361.15 million. One year ago, it earned 11 cents per share on revenue of $249.50 million. By providing individuals and businesses the ability to digitize an agreement process, it greatly benefited from remote work and social distancing. Its stock skyrocketed 80% during the past six months with almost 210% year to date, whereas the S&P rose only 12% during the same timeframe. But its valuation is being questioned with the upcoming vaccine. DocuSign needs to show it diversify its offerings, such as its contract lifecycle management platform.SalesforceWall Street expects Salesforce to earn 75 cents per share on revenue of $5.25 billion. This figure equals earnings during the same quarter last year, whereas revenue amounted to $4.51 billion.The company's SaaS business model and its customer relationship management services have become a must have for developing companies. But after Dow Jones report that the cloud giant is in advanced talks to acquire Slack WORK at an undisclosed amount, the stock retracted. With its negotiating and collaborating features Slack would immediately position Salesforce to challenge Microsoft MSFT enterprise dominance it owes to Office365. But with Slack now valued at $22 billion,  it would Salesforce's largest acquisition and based on how the market received the news, investors seem concerned.Five BelowThe youth-focused retailer has been one of the rare specialty retailers to outperform the COVID-19 storm that left many retailers fighting for mere existence. While temporary store closures did hurt its sales during fiscal first quarter, the retailer managed to bounce back to growth in its fiscal second quarter, with sales inching higher by 2%. But Five Below needs to show gains in both store expansion and sales growth to support management's ambitious plans to expand its footprint.KrogerAlthough demand for consumer staples remains elevated, rivals like Walmart Inc WMT and Costco Wholesale Corporation COST reported slowing sales gains. Yet, Wall Street expects this leading grocery store chain to report head-turning growth metrics, while forecasting a revenue boost of 7% for the quarter.The question of the weekBesides their earnings reports, the above companies have an important question to answer. Considering these companies greatly benefited from remote work, they need to prove they can keep their growth momentum even if positive vaccine developments encourage consumers to go back to offices and stores.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

82,110,AAPL,"Verizon, AT&T Q1 Results On Tap As Consumer Scene Looks Bright",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13573539,"Verizon Communications Inc. VZ and AT&T Inc. T, wireless industry competitors with diverging business strategies, are among the first major companies in the newly formed Communication Services sector to report this quarter. Investors will see if their revenue gets an expected boost, perhaps from the improving consumer scene.VZ and T are the two largest wireless carriers in the U.S. by subscribers, and both companies stocks struggled after their previous quarterly reports. VZ is scheduled to report its earnings before the opening bell Tuesday, April 23, and T reports before the bell on Wednesday, April 24.The Communication Services sector was created just a few quarters ago, combining companies that were in Info Tech and Consumer Discretionary with those from the old Telecom sector.  With the mass amount of consumers in nearly nonstop contact with communications devices, companies here like VZ and T might consider the thriving consumer as a good sign for their bottom line. And a stronger than expected U.S. jobs report in March, which revealed the healthiest jobs scene in nearly 50 years, might help reassure investors about consumer confidence.By some third-party analyst projections, the Communications Services sector is expected to lead all sectors in revenue growth this quarter, although the earnings expectations aren’t so rosy. Wall Street expectations for T, specifically, fit that bill, but the forecast for VZ is more muted.Both companies shares had a positive start to the year, but in the second quarter that changed. Year to date, VZ shares were up 2.3% as of April 18, with momentum slowing the past month, while T shares were up 11.9% on a steady rally.T is expected to report adjusted EPS of $0.86, up a smidge from $0.85 in the prior-year quarter, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected at $45.1 billion, up 18.6% from a year ago.VZ is expected to report adjusted EPS of $1.17, on par with the prior-year quarter, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected at $32.2 billion, also about flat from a year ago.FIGURE 1: CHOPPY TELECOMS: Telecom companies, including Verizon (VZ - candlestick) and AT&T (T - purple line) have seen a good deal of up and down movement since last fall. Though some analysts expect healthy growth in the Communications Services sector as a whole, whether such growth might extend to these two companies remains to be seen. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Verizon Steps Up in Streaming MarketRecently, VZ started to roll out its 5G network in Chicago and Minneapolis, kicking off the era of super-speed, which could have an impact on nearly every corner of the Communications Services sector. Its planning to launch the 5G network in 30 major cities this year. For consumers who can tap into it, 5G can offer speeds of about 10 times faster than they might normally get, however CEO Hans Vestburg cautioned that the company will not likely see revenue from 5G upgrades until 2020.The rollout is so far largely symbolic because most consumers don’t have the Motorola phone for the clip-on modem that will upgrade the service, nor is the infrastructure build out completed. However it offers potential for revenue growth for a number of companies in the communications sector besides VZ, including T.Meanwhile, VZ has also been trying to find a sweet spot in pricing. It increased the in-store cost to upgrade or activate its phones to $40 from $30, citing the fact that consumers get a “full service experience” there. In tandem, the cost for upgrades made online, which would be cheaper for the company, have been reduced to $20 from $30 for the consumer.Last quarter, VZ’s revenue missed Wall Street estimates and its quarterly profit was flat. Shares slid 3% in premarket trade. Still, VZ added nearly twice the number of new wireless subscribers that third-party analysts expected.Verizon OptionsFor VZ, options traders have priced in a 2.8% ($1.62) stock move in either direction around the coming earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim® platform.Put options have been active at the weekly 59, 60, and 58 strikes, while call option activity has been heaviest at the 58 strikes. Implied volatility was at the 24th percentile as of this morning. Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.AT&T Keeps Entertainment FocusWith the start of the next generation of internet connectivity led by VZ’s 5G rollout, T seems to be remain focused on entertainment endeavors. Remember, last year T acquired media giant Time Warner for $85 billion, which gave it a bank of content.Now, competition in the media and entertainment market is heating up, especially in streaming, where T has said it wants to launch a more robust streaming service anchored by HBO at a “compelling price point” by the end of the year. That will have to contend with the influx of new streaming offering from major players like Walt Disney Co DIS and Apple Inc. AAPL.T’s debt load, which many analysts say is significantly high, is also likely to continue to be on investors’ radars again this quarter. It held $171 billion in debt at the end of last quarter, and investors will soon learn whether its efforts to pare back its debt are having any impact. T has said it will pay down up to $20 billion by the end of this year in part by selling non-core assets, which it expects will raise about $8 billion. The wireless giant just sold its minority stake in Hulu, valued at $1.43 billion, which its using toward debt reduction.Last quarter, T saw slower wireless subscriber growth than expected with a net gain of 134,000 new subscribers, short of the 208,000 third-party analysts were expecting. The DirectTV Now streaming service lost 267,000 members, more than expected and which the company blamed in part on customers leaving after a promotional introductory period. Total revenue was short of third-party estimates, and earnings were in line. Its stock slid 4% in the aftermath of the report.AT&T OptionsFor T, options traders have priced in a 3.3% ($1.06) stock move in either direction around the coming earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim platform.Put options have been active at the weekly 32, 32.5, and 33 strikes, while call option activity has been heaviest at the 30 and 32 strikes.

83,111,AAPL,"Earnings Beats Keep Coming, With Verizon, CocaCola, Twitter, Procter & Gamble All Solid",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13578370,"The hits keep coming. Several major companies reported early Tuesday and beat Wall Street’s estimates, continuing what so far has been a surprisingly solid earnings season if you measure it vs. preseason expectations.Some of the companies surpassing analysts’ projections today were familiar ones, including The Coca-Cola Co KO, Twitter Inc TWTR, Verizon Communications Inc VZ, United Technologies Corporation UTX, and Procter & Gamble Co PG. Shares of TWTR leaped 7% in pre-market trading after the company posted stronger-than-expected results and added more subscribers than many analysts had guessed. Also, several of the reporting companies raised their guidance, including Verizon and Procter & Gamble. That’s a possible sign that they’re seeing strength in the economy. PG raised its dividend again, another possible reflection of corporate health.The earnings barrage continues most of this week, with about 30% of S&P 500 companies reporting in just these five days. The earnings season began with low expectations, but so far it’s been a bit better than some people thought and actually appears to have the potential to turn out OK. The fear was this was going to be a disaster from the onset. Tuesday’s statistics continued the trend toward more positive results. It’s especially nice to see some of the multinationals like KO and PG come in with solid results because it could point to strength beyond just the U.S. and suggest that the strong dollar hasn’t been a barrier to overseas sales.Through the end of last week, Q1 earnings were down 3.9% year-over-year, FactSet said. That was better than some early estimates, but still the worst earnings performance since Q2 2016. Average revenue growth of 5% is actually a bit better than some analysts had expected. More than three-quarters of companies reporting before this week have beaten estimates. Consider keeping an eye on those overall estimates to see if they start to improve. More earnings are on the way this afternoon with a menu that features eBay Inc EBAY and Texas Instruments Incorporated TXN. The TXN report could give investors one of their first glimpses into the semiconductor sector and how it performed in Q1. Semiconductor shares have been flying high most of the year, and some analysts see these stocks as canaries in the coal mine for tech demand. Also keep in mind that TXN is an Apple Inc. AAPL supplier (see more below).Tomorrow morning stays busy with AT&T Inc T, Boeing Co BA, Caterpillar Inc CAT, and Biogen Inc BIIB. There’s likely to be a lot of emphasis on the trade picture as BA and CAT report, since both companies have a big presence in China. However, BA’s conference call is probably going to be dominated by questions about the troubled 737 MAX program and how it might affect orders for the company’s aircraft.Checking back on TWTR, the company added 9 million monthly active users in Q1, compared with some analysts’ projections for a decline as TWTR roots out harmful content. Revenue rose 18% year-over-year.On the data front this morning, new home sales for March are up next. The Briefing.com consensus is for a seasonally adjusted 646,000, down from 667,000 the prior month. Existing home sales for March reported yesterday came in below expectations.Mundane MondayExcept for a couple of sectors which we’ll get to in a minute, Monday’s session had kind of a wait and see feel to it. A lot of earnings are about to come down the pike, so many investors might be holding off on taking new positions until they know more. The sectors that took exception to the overall vanilla flavor of the day Monday were Energy and some retail names in Consumer Staples. Energy jumped more than 2% and it looked like mainly a crude play based on the U.S. announcing the end of sanctions exemptions for importers of Iranian oil. With that news, U.S. crude prices jumped above $65 a barrel to new six-month highs. While that news seemed to help Energy companies and didn’t appear to have much effect on the rest of the market, it might not be just a one-day story. One of the countries importing crude from Iran is China, and its government lashed out against the Trump administration’s announcement. It might be worth watching to see if the U.S. is ready to actually step up and punish Chinese oil importers if they buy Iranian crude once the sanctions exemptions expire next month. Could this raise friction as the U.S. and China try to finalize a trade deal? We’ll have to wait and see.Another thing to maybe think about is the impact of higher gas prices on U.S. consumers. Retail sales rose 1.6% in March, but one element of that was a huge monthly rise in gasoline sales as prices rose to levels more than 60 cents a gallon above where they were at the start of 2019. The question is whether higher gas costs might push down consumer spending in other areas.Tough Start To Week for Retail StocksOne area that might face some friction from higher gas prices is brick-and-mortar retail, where a handful of companies got punished Monday and the S&P Retail Index fell more than 2%. Shares of Bed, Bath & Beyond Inc BBBY, Dillard’s, Inc. DDS, and Urban Outfitters, Inc. URBN, all showed up on Wall Street’s discount aisle. For some, there was actual negative news, which in the case of DDS included an analyst downgrade.For others, it might have been a combination of things, including possible fallout from recently rising Treasury bond yields, which can sometimes make dividend-paying stocks in the Staples sector a little less attractive to some investors. Interestingly, if that’s the case, it might contrast with a recent trend that saw some investors embracing so-called “defensive” sectors due in part to the weakness in bond yields earlier this year. The benchmark 10-year yield pivoted around 2.58% on Monday, up from lows below 2.4% late last month but still a bit below the 2.7% area where they began 2019. It creeped closer to 2.6% early Tuesday. The closely-watched yield curve steepened Monday, giving 10-year yields a 20-basis point advantage over two-year yields.Typically, rising yields and a steepening curve often signal investor optimism about the economy. That could also help explain why some of the more cyclical sectors continue to do well. Info Tech, Communication Services, and Energy—all considered cyclicals—led the sector scorecard Monday. On the other end of things, Real Estate, Utilities, and Staples all lost ground.The sector that came under all kinds of pressure earlier this month was Health Care, and that might continue to be worth keeping an eye on this week. Health Care rose a bit on Monday, but you can’t necessarily rule out more possible weakness on worries about political pressure to bring down drug prices.One stock bucking the lower Staples trend Monday was Kimberly Clark (KMB), which rose more than 5% after beating Wall Street’s earnings estimates. It looks like KMB might have been able to pass along some higher prices to customers, which has been a challenge for some Staples companies lately.Figure 1: DISCOUNT BIN: Retail stocks (candlestick) had a rough start to the week and have only risen about 10% so far this year, well below the broader market. Meanwhile, Energy stocks (purple line) got a boost Monday from a crude rally. Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  
On A Cautious Note: Though this year’s rally has been led mostly by cyclical sectors like Industrials and Info Tech, risk-oriented stock funds—especially low-volatility ones—took in a record $8 billion during Q1, Barron’s reported, citing Morningstar data. Low-volatility funds tend to gravitate toward non-cyclical sectors like Consumer Staples, Real Estate, and Utilities, which according to historic data tend to offer investors a bit more protection when markets sag, though past isn’t necessarily prologue. The recent popularity of these low-volatility funds might reflect investor reaction to soft Treasury yields, which often make dividend-paying stocks appear more enticing as their yields come closer to matching government Treasury yields. However, it’s also kind of interesting to see lots of investor money pouring into what some analysts call “defensive” sectors even as stocks approach record highs. Maybe there’s some caution building as investors wonder just how much farther this rally might go as the S&P 500 Index (SPX) nears record highs.Apple Watch: The end of a legal dispute between Apple and Qualcomm, Inc. QCOM last week puts the spotlight on Apple suppliers just over a week ahead of AAPL’s earnings report. Shares of QCOM, a company that supplies chips for AAPL devices, got a big boost on the news, but investors might also want to check how some other AAPL suppliers are doing so far this year for possible clues into AAPL’s Q1. From a stock performance perspective alone, there see to be some positive aspects. QCOM isn’t the only AAPL supplier stock on the rise recently. Shares of semiconductor firm Analog Devices, Inc. ADI are up about one-third so far in 2019, and the firm’s fiscal Q1 revenue hit the high end of its guidance. Shares of Jabil Inc JBL, a company that supplies phone casings for AAPL, are up about 30%. Shares of Texas Instruments, which also supplies a variety of components for iPads and iPhones and reports earnings later today, are also on a roll. All these companies have other fundamental influences besides AAPL, but it seems worth noting that none are being punished for the slowdown in iPhone sales growth. Maybe consider checking TXN later today to see if AAPL gets mentioned on its call, and we’ll preview AAPL’s earnings here early next week.Value Check: Despite the recent rally toward all-time highs for the S&P 500 Index (SPX) and falling year-over-year earnings per share for many reporting companies in Q1 so far, stock valuations aren’t looking too stretched vs. historic norms. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for the SPX going into this week stood at 16.8, not much above the five-year average of 16.4, according to FactSet. It’s up quite a bit from lows under 15 late last year, but remains below highs above 18 earlier in 2018. One thing that could keep the P/E from rising much more is if Q1 earnings come in better than expected.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

84,112,AAPL,Clouds Part: Amazon And Microsoft Cloud Businesses In Focus Ahead Of Earnings,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13580448,"Two U.S. companies arguably dominate the growing cloud infrastructure, and they both report later this week even as they wrestle each other to be the second highest-valued stock by market capitalization.We’re talking about Microsoft MSFT and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, both companies that started out known for one thing (software in the case of MSFT and online books for AMZN), and have expanded their reach into other business areas over the years as they’ve grown. Now, the two are duking it out in cloud computing. Microsoft is scheduled to report fiscal Q3 earnings after the close Wednesday, with Amazon expected to report Q1 earnings after the close Thursday.As a reminder, cloud computing provides a way for businesses to access servers, storage, databases and application services over the Internet. A company like AMZN or MSFT owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these services, while their business customers can use what they need through the web without having to build or buy expensive hardware platforms.As the two companies’ cloud businesses grow, they’re touting partnerships and expanding their reach even to competitors in an effort to climb to the top.For instance, earlier this year, MSFT announced a partnership with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. WBA to develop new health care delivery models and for WBA to migrate most of its infrastructure into MSFT’s Azure cloud. This followed similar announcements by MSFT of deals with Kroger Co KR and Walmart Inc WMT. The interesting thing, as research firm CFRA notes, is that all three of those companies are also competitors of cloud leader AMZN.At the same time, Amazon counts one of its own biggest competitors—Apple Inc AAPL—as a major customer for its cloud platform, with CNBC reporting this week that AAPL is spending more than $30 million a month on Amazon’s cloud even as AAPL invests to build its own data storage. With AAPL customers using one billion devices a month, AAPL has vast storage requirements, and AMZN’s cloud might be one beneficiary even though the two are rivals in other business areas.Getting back to MSFT, total commercial cloud revenues rose 48% in Q2 to $9 billion while Azure revenues rose 76%. Azure growth was also 76% in Q1. The Q2 Azure growth was nothing to sneeze at, but the same as the previous quarter. Now we’ll see how things went in the first few months of 2019 at a time when corporate capital expenditures appeared to soften, according to the Fed and recent economic. data. One question is whether cloud growth in the company’s fiscal Q2 got hurt by the slowing global economy and may have bounced back in fiscal Q3. Shares of MSFT are up sharply so far this year, perhaps a sign that investors are optimistic that’s the case.Beyond the CloudThat said, analysts are expecting big things from both AMZN and MSFT, and that goes beyond cloud computing. Since MSFT started out as a personal computer software firm and Amazon started out as an online goods seller, those categories still play big roles in both their businesses. There’s optimism on Wall Street about MSFT’s Microsoft Office platform and Amazon’s impressive operating income gains. A healthy U.S. consumer could potentially help lift Amazon’s online retail and Whole Foods businesses.However, Amazon Prime growth appears to be slowing, according to market research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. That’s possibly troubling because Prime members tend to spend more at Amazon than non-Prime members.Meanwhile, over at MSFT, there was some sequential revenue growth slowdown in both Productivity and Business Products and More Personal Computing segments from fiscal Q1 to Q2. Trends in those businesses—which include Office Commercial and Windows Commercial products—could be something to consider checking in fiscal Q3.Looking back guidance for Q1, AMZN said net sales are expected to be between $56 billion and $60 billion, or to grow between 10% and 18% compared with Q1 2018. The revenue guidance was a bit lower than some on Wall Street had expected, and some analysts called it downbeat. Amazon also talked about possibly increasing its spending growth in 2019, which could potentially weigh on profits.MSFT, whose Q2 revenue came in slightly below third-party consensus expectations, also shared revenue guidance that just missed the Street’s thoughts. Microsoft said then it expects fiscal Q3 revenue of between $29.4 billion and $30.1 billion. The midpoint of that range was just under the average analyst estimate when MSFT released the guidance. One thing to consider closely watching is MSFT’s revenue growth, which slipped from fiscal Q1 to fiscal Q2. It rose 12% year-over-year in Q2. And for anyone keeping score, MSFT enters earnings just ahead of AMZN in the battle for second place in total market capitalization (AAPL is back in the lead). As of the start of this week, MSFT had a market cap of around $950 billion, with AMZN at $922 billion. AAPL remains in sight of both at $965 billion.Microsoft Earnings and Options ActivityWhen MSFT releases results, it is expected to report adjusted EPS of $1, up from $0.95 in the prior-year quarter, on revenue of $29.84 billion, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. That revenue would represent 11.3% growth from a year ago. Options traders have priced in approximately a 2.8% stock price move in either direction around the upcoming earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim® platform. Implied volatility was at the 21st percentile as of this morning. Looking at the April 26 weekly option expiration, call volume has been active at the 124 and 125 strikes, but the most active strike by far has been the 126 calls. Put volume has been active at the 120 and 123 strikes.Amazon Earnings and Options ActivityWhen AMZN releases results, it is expected to report adjusted EPS of $4.72, up from $3.27 in the prior-year quarter, on revenue of $59.65 billion, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. That revenue would represent 16.9% growth from a year ago.Options traders have priced in approximately a 3.5% stock price move in either direction around the upcoming earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim® platform. Implied volatility was at the 34th percentile as of this morning. Looking at the April 26 weekly options expiration, call volume was pretty light overall but heaviest at the 1900 strike. Put volume was also light, but heaviest at the 1850 and 1860 strikes.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

85,114,AAPL,Alphabet's Q1 Report Will Show Whether Advertising Trends Pickup,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13606028,"Even amid pressure from increased competition in online advertising realm, Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG shares have been on a rip this year, up about 21.5% year to date as of April 24, versus a 17% rise in the S&P 500 (SPX). The search engine giant is scheduled to release Q1 results after the closing bell April 29.As one of the FAANGs, which include Facebook Inc FB, Apple Inc AAPL, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Netflix, Inc. NFLX, Google is a kind of bellwether for big players in the technology sector. For much of 2018, FAANGs’ momentum helped drive a solid rally for much of the year, and then played a large role in Q4’s steep losses. So far this year, FAANGs have had a lesser role in the more-broad-based rally, but their positive drive has certainly also contributed.GOOGL itself doesn’t provide quarterly guidance, but the Street expects it to report Q1 adjusted EPS of $10.56, down from $13.33 in the prior-year quarter, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected at $37.33 billion, up 19.9% from a year ago.Digital Advertising Revenue Hit Plateau in Q4In Q4, GOOGL shares slid about 3% after it reported rising costs and a decline in advertising prices, where it gleans a good deal of revenue. Its core advertising revenue grew 20% to $32.6 billion, which was about the same rate of growth it saw in Q3, meaning that line of business had hit a bit of a plateau. Meanwhile, the costs for traffic acquisition, for example what it pays to other companies to be a default search engine, climbed 15% year over year to $7.44 billion.Still, GOOGL showed it continued to expand its hardware sales and cloud business, and earnings and revenue topped Street estimates. Q4 revenue was $39.3 billion, up 22% from the year prior, and earnings were $12.77 per share, up 12% year over year.Its “other revenue,” which includes Google Play, hardware and cloud computing, increased 31% year over year to $6.49 billion, although the company did not break down that number to show exactly where the growth came from. CEO Sundar Pichai said in an earnings call that Google Cloud was one of the company’s “fastest-growing business segments.” He also said the company “more than doubled” the number of Cloud Platform deals over $1 million and the number of multi-year contracts, although he didn’t provide specifics.“Everything we do at Google is united by the mission of making information accessible and useful for everyone. Providing accurate and trusted information at the scale the internet has reached is an extremely complex challenge and one that is constantly getting harder,” Pichai said.In events since its last quarterly report, GOOGL was hit with a roughly $1.7 billion antitrust fine from the European Commission over what the commission said was abuse of its dominant position in the market. GOOGL is accounting for the entire fine in the first quarter, so that will reduce its earnings and operating income, as well as its net income. That’s the third massive fine for GOOGL from the EU in about three years, totaling about $9.4 billion, so investors are likely hoping its regulatory headaches are over soon.GOOGL Options ActivityThe options market has priced in about a 3.6% stock move in either direction around the upcoming earnings release.For the May 3 options expiration, volume has been light overall. Put options have been most active at the 1230 strike. On the call side, the 1300 strike has been the most active, followed by the 1310 strike. Implied volatility was at the 42nd percentile as of Friday morning. Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

86,115,AAPL,"Intel Guidance Disappoints, But Earnings Season Overall Has Surprised To Upside",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13606309,"A much-stronger-than-expected U.S. gross domestic product print gave investors something else to cheer about amid an earnings season where many companies have been faring better than had been forecast. In its first estimate of Q1 GDP, the Commerce Department said the benchmark measure of economic activity rose at a 3.2% annual rate. A Briefing.com consensus had expected a growth rate of 1.9%.While the unexpected strength is a good sign and indicates that the domestic economy may not be as bad off as some have feared amid worries about a global growth slowdown, there is still room for caution as the government will have two more chances to revise the figure. The last time the U.S. government reported its GDP number, it said the economy expanded less than previously thought in the final quarter of last year, with its third estimate of Q4 GDP showing an annualized rate of increase of 2.2% compared with a previous reading of 2.6%.The GDP data come amid signs of slowing growth in Europe and Asia as the continuing trade war between the United States and China drags on. However, overall, optimism about a U.S.-China trade deal has increased, helping boost stocks this year along with a positive market reaction to a more dovish Federal Reserve. Although earnings from big-name companies have been mixed, this earnings season overall is turning out better than many analysts had feared, and the stronger-than-expected results have also been helping boost shares. After the bell Thursday, Starbucks Corporation SBUX reported quarterly adjusted earnings per share and same-store sales that beat expectations. It also raised its full-year earnings outlook. Also after the close, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, reported a blowout quarter, with earnings per share handily beating expectations. However, its Q2 operating profit guidance fell short of analyst expectations. On the other side of the spectrum, Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM reported weaker-than-expected earnings and revenue, and its shares were down more than 2% in pre-market trading. Intel Corporation INTC shares were also on the back foot, falling more than 7% after the company gave softer-than-expected revenue guidance for 2019. That looks disappointing for the semiconductor space, but remember more earnings from the sector are on the way, including Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD next week and Nvidia Corporation NVDA in mid-May, so we’ll have to see how all that plays out.It’s been a solid week for earnings, but with expectations being so low, companies that beat earnings aren’t being rewarded as much as companies that miss forecasts are getting smacked.MMMoving LowerInvestors and traders slapped a sticky note saying “sell” on the back of 3M (MMM) Thursday after the multinational industrial conglomerate reported earnings and revenue that missed expectations, announced 2,000 layoffs, and cut its 2019 earnings forecast. Its shares dived nearly 13% in their worst day since Black Monday in October 1987, making them the biggest loser in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI). MMM also dragged down the S&P 500’s (SPX) Industrials sector, which fell nearly 2% and was the worst performing of the index’s 11 sectors. Weak demand in China contributed to the company’s disappointing quarterly performance. Yesterday’s $DJI move was another example of why we often say it’s probably best not to follow that index too closely. Remember, it’s just 30 stocks, so a move like MMM’s can really make losses look dramatic for the entire index. There was kind of a dichotomy yesterday between the $DJI and SPX that might have looked confusing at first glance.Microsoft, Facebook ShineMeanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (COMP) was able to finish in the green on help from Facebook and Microsoft Corporation MSFT, which both reported solid quarterly numbers.FB shares rallied more than 5.8% after the social media giant reported better-than forecast revenue. FB said it had 1.56 billion daily active users and 2.38 billion monthly active users. Average revenue per user of $6.42 beat expectations. Facebook, Messenger, and WhatsApp Stories features now have 500 million daily active users. This doesn’t necessarily mean FB is out of the woods on some other issues, like privacy and possible increased government regulation. However, it’s interesting to see that at least for now, that doesn’t appear to be affecting revenue much.MSFT reported earnings and revenue that beat analyst expectations, helped by sales in the company’s cloud business. The company’s market capitalization surpassed $1 trillion after the report, although it settled below that figure. (See more below.) Figure 1: The PHLX Semiconductor Index fell Thursday, snapping a string of record closes. Xilinx (XLNX) shares fell the most of any in the index, dropping more than 17%. The index is expected to fall further this morning as shares of Intel fell over 7% in pre-market trading after the company offered weak guidance. Data Source: Nasdaq. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  Cutting the Cord: The streaming services sector is heating up as more and more people cut the cord and leave cable in favor of streaming services from the likes of AMZN, which on Thursday said it has more than 30 million active users for its Fire TV streaming devices. Apple Inc AAPL has plans to launch its own streaming service. Also, Walt Disney Co DIS has announced its own offering, and according to CNBC Thursday is in talks to buy Comcast’s 30% stake in streaming platform Hulu, which would boost what DIS already owns of the platform. All this means more competition for Netflix, shares of which fell almost 1.6% percent Thursday. Three’s a Cloud: After reporting strong quarterly results helped by its cloud-computing business after the close Wednesday, MSFT became the third U.S. company to hit $1 trillion in market capitalization. The other two to hit that figure earlier were AAPL and AMZN, which hit that mark last year before sinking back below that level later in 2018. To put $1 trillion in perspective, when these companies were above the mark, their market valuations were larger than the gross domestic product of all but 16 nations on earth, based on 2018 International Monetary Fund GDP figures. Durable Goods Orders Pop: At a time when economic data has been mixed, durable goods orders numbers on Thursday scored one for the bullish side. The headline figure reported by the Census Bureau showed a 2.7% gain for new orders for manufactured durable goods in March, beating a Breifing.com consensus expectation of just a 0.9%. Perhaps more importantly for the economy, orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose a robust 1.3%. As this later figure is considered a proxy for business investment, it’s possible that the data are reflecting increased confidence in the business climate in general and in hopes of a resolution to the U.S.-China trade dispute in particular. The trade war has weighed on sentiment for some time now, so increased orders could indicate purchasing managers are becoming more confident that a deal will get done soon.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

87,116,AAPL,Apple Q2 Earnings Preview: What To Expect,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13571728,"Apple, Inc. AAPL investors are hoping Apple can keep the ball rolling when it reports fiscal second-quarter earnings after the market close on April 30. Here’s a look at what Wall Street is expecting from Apple.The NumbersAnalysts are expecting Apple to report second-quarter EPS of $2.37. Analysts are also calling for revenue of $57.4 billion, down 6.1 percent from a year ago. Apple investors will also be watching unit sales and Service segment revenue closely. Revenue from iPhone sales was down 15 percent in the first quarter, but Services revenue was up 19 percent from a year ago.Looking ahead to the second quarter, Wall Street analysts are expecting Apple to guide for EPS of $2.08 on $51.93 billion in revenue.Analysts' TakeSeveral analysts have weighed in on Apple stock ahead of earnings.Raymond James analyst Chris Caso is predicting iPhone unit sales of 42 million, down 19.6 percent from a year ago. In addition to total iPhone sales, Caso said investors should pay close attention to trends in mix and average sales price.“Our current model assumes blended ASP could drop 15% y/y by the December quarter - with the mix-shift toward the low-end likely to negatively impact sales, margins, and related AppleCare revenue,” Caso wrote in a note.CFRA analyst Angelo Zino is forecasting a second-quarter EPS beat of $2.38 from Apple.“While we expect iPhone demand to be challenged by lengthening replacement cycles until a 5G device is launched in calendar year 2020, we are encouraged by recent growth in wearables, specifically the Apple Watch,” Zino wrote.CFRA has a Buy rating and $210 target.Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan is calling for EPS of $2.33, slightly below consensus estimates. Mohan said gross margins will be key for Apple.""If Apple can report a quarter of 37-38% gross margins (within guidance range) despite the price cuts and guide q/q gross margins higher in the range of 37.5-38.5%, we would argue that the story has an upward bias to gross margins, which would be a major positive,"" Mohan wrote.Bank of America has a Buy rating and $220 target.UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said Apple's earnings and guidance should be fine, despite iPhone mix headwinds.""We model rev/EPS of $56.5B/$2.33 vs Street $57.6B/$2.36 and $55-59B guide on slightly lower iPhone rev due to lower ASP ($687 vs $745), supported by CIRP data and UBS procurement estimates both suggesting mix shift to older models,"" Arcuri wrote.UBS has a Buy rating and $235 target.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said investors can expect a rebound in Apple's China numbers in the quarter.""As we have discussed with investors, it has been Apple's pricing hubris on iPhone XR that was the major factor in the company's December earnings debacle in China, however with some recent price cuts demand trends are slowly turning around in this all-important region for Cupertino as we expect the Street will see when the company reports on Tuesday after the bell,"" Ives wrote.Wedbush has an Outperform rating and $225 target.Volatility Ahead?Last quarter, Apple stock initially jumped 6 percent following a modest earnings beat. Apple has a history of volatile earnings reactions.According to Optionslam.com, Apple’s seven-day implied movement ahead of earnings based on the weekly options market is 4 percent.Apple's stock is already up 29 percent year-to-date.

88,117,AAPL,"This Week, Market Eyes China Talks, Fed Meeting As Earnings Continue",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13615925,"After record-setting closes last week, the market this morning seems to be anticipating another busy week of earnings, a calendar full of economic reports and a rate decision from the Federal Reserve.Trade talks between the U.S. and China also appear to be at the fore as representatives from the world’s two largest economies are scheduled to continue negotiations in Beijing. Ahead of the meeting, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told The New York Times that the two sides are “getting into the final laps” and have “made a lot of progress.” On the Chinese data front, numbers showed that industrial profits in the Asian nation rose in March. It’s a good sign from an economy that has gotten beaten up by the trade war that has sparked worries about global economic growth.The news comes ahead of a week that’s packed with U.S. economic data reports. This morning, data on March core personal consumption expenditures, which are the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation, came in below a Briefing.com consensus expectation for a 0.1% rise. Consumer confidence figures are due out later in the week and might be interesting to compare with last week’s consumer sentiment numbers. Perhaps the most closely watched number could be the nonfarm payrolls figure from the Labor Department. The report is another major benchmark for the economy, and it could be interesting to see whether we get another stronger-than-expected reading like we did last time.In other big economic news this week, the Fed is expected to hold interest rates steady at its two-day policy setting meeting, CME futures prices suggest. Still, investors and traders are likely to parse the language accompanying the decision to see if they can glean any insight into the central bank’s thinking on the trajectory of the economy and interest rates. The week also includes earnings from Apple Inc AAPL, Alphabet GOOG, McDonald’s Corp MCD, General Electric Company GE, and Merck & Co, Inc. MRK, among many others. This earnings season has been characterized by very low expectations. But many companies have been reporting better earnings than were forecast, forming a big part of why the SPX and COMP closed at record highs. The optimism is building on two issues that have already been helping the market rise strongly this year after slumping drastically late last year. One is that, even though the trade war between the world’s two largest economies is dragging on, market participants seem to be seeing light at the end of that tunnel. Also, the Fed’s dovish pivot—after fears last year that the central bank would end up being too aggressive despite low inflation—has boosted market sentiment. GDP Porridge Just RightThe U.S. market finished up last week on a positive note, with the S&P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq (COMP) posting record closes on Friday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) also gaining ground after strong U.S. economic data.The gains came after the Commerce Department in its first estimate of Q1 GDP said the benchmark measure of economic activity rose at a 3.2% annual rate. A Briefing.com consensus had expected a growth rate of 1.9%.The strong print helped to allay fears about a faltering domestic economy amid worries about European and Chinese economic growth as the U.S.-China trade war drags on. It also marks a resurgence of the Goldilocks economic scenario. The strong GDP number comes as the Fed has become much more dovish amid signs of muted inflation. So the picture Friday’s data seems to paint for the U.S. economy is one where growth isn’t too hot or too cold.Earnings Season ContinuesThe market was also helped by Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN reporting a blowout quarter. Its shares rose more than 2.5% after the online retailing giant’s earnings per share handily beat expectations.The gains helped boost the Consumer Discretionary sector, a cyclical segment of the market that tends to do better as the economy performs more robustly, and vice versa. If people are feeling better about their job situation and spending power, they might be more inclined to splurge on an online shopping spree.Or, they might buy a truck. The biggest gainer in the sector on Friday was Ford Motor Company F, which rallied more than 10.7% after reporting stronger-than-forecast earnings and revenues amid strong demand for pickup trucks and SUVs in North America. But not all was rosy in earnings land. Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported profit that was roughly half of what it earned a year ago, and the earnings were well under analysts’ forecasts. Revenues also came up short, helping push the oil giant’s shares down more than 2% and helping make the energy sector the day’s biggest loser by far.Oil prices also weighed on the sector as the U.S. crude price fell nearly 3% after President Trump said he had told OPEC the cartel had to bring down gasoline prices. The fall in oil prices comes after a sharp gain recently as the Trump administration said it would not extend waivers that would have allowed several countries to keep on buying Iranian oil.Crude prices continued to fall this morning. If the pressure continues, airlines and other transportation companies would stand to benefit from a resulting fall in fuel prices. Meanwhile, in M&A news in the industry, Anadarko Petroleum Company APC said it would resume talking with Occidental Petroleum OXY, which has offered $38 billion for Anadarko compared with Chevron Corporation’s CVX roughly $33 billion bid. Figure 1: Oil prices dropped sharply Friday after President Trump said he had told OPEC to lower fuel costs. Crude has been supported this year by OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. Data Source: CME Group. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  GDP Drilldown: Trade has been in the news for months now as the United States and China have slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on billions of dollars of goods from each other and headlines about negotiations between the world’s two largest economies have captivated Wall Street. Trade also figured prominently in the surprisingly strong GDP reading on Friday. The United States’ exports of goods and services rose 3.7% on a seasonally adjusted annual rate while imports declined by the same percentage. That left net exports to contribute more than 1 percentage point to the headline GDP number. But it’s probably worth noting that the net export component is a volatile piece of the GDP puzzle. Plus, the government still has two more chances to revise the number.  Texas Sized Exports: They say everything’s bigger in Texas. That proved true for exports from the Lone Star State in January and February. Exports from the state topped $50 billion during the period, representing roughly 20% of all U.S. exports, according to data from WISERTrade reported by CNBC. Exports during the period grew 9% from the previous year, handily beating national export growth of 2.6%, the article noted. What drove the Texas-sized exports? You guessed it: oil and gas. If you’ll recall, oil prices were on the rise in January and February, and, according to the article, Texas oil and gas exports jumped in value by 45%. As oil prices have continued to gain ground amid OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran, it could be interesting to see whether the next batch of data will show Texas exports continuing to outstrip the national figures. Going Shopping? Friday was a good day for U.S. economic news. On top of the sterling GDP report, the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index for April showed a reading of 97.2 when a Briefing.com consensus had expected a print of 96.7. That’s a good sign for the U.S. economy, which is heavily dependent on consumer spending. The strong number may have added to help from AMZN earnings to help boost the consumer discretionary sector by 0.93% on Friday. “The key takeaway from the report is that 44% of consumers said they were feeling better about their financial prospects for the year ahead,” Briefing.com said. “That is the highest level for that reading since 2004 and another indication that should quiet recession talk.”Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

89,118,AAPL,Spotify Hits 100M Premium Subs; Buckingham Sees 20% Upside,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13615540,"Music streaming service Spotify Technology SA SPOT reported first-quarter results Monday before the market open. The Headline NumbersSpotify's first-quarter EPS loss of 88 cents missed the consensus estimate for a 39-cent loss, while sales of $1.69 billion beat the $1.66-billion estimate. The company reported roughly 33-percent revenue growth and a narrower loss for its first quarter. Premium revenue, accounting for roughly 92 percent of the total revenues, climbed 34 percent. Average revenue per user, or ARPU, remained flat at 4.71 euros ($5.26). Excluding the currency impact, ARPU was down 2 percent, with product mix changes and geographic mix accounting for the decline.Ad-supported revenue, though growing 24 percent, was below expectations, the company said.Spotify noted a small incremental benefit from podcasts in the first quarter following its acquisitions of Gimlet Media and Anchor in February, and the successful rollout of Spotify-owned exclusive content. The company expects podcasts revenue to accelerate through 2019.""The results came in at the high end of expectations and seem to confirm that Spotify is not imminently getting 'big footed' by its large full ecosystem tech company competitors,"" Buckingham Research Group's Matthew Harrigan said in a Monday note. Strong User MetricsTotal monthly active users, or MAUs, climbed 26 percent year-over-year and 5 percent quarter-over-quarter to 217 million. Premium subscribers hit the 100-million mark by virtue of 32-percent year-over-year growth and 6-percent sequential growth.The company had guided to 215-220 million MAUs and 97-100 million premium subscribers.In comparison, rival Apple Inc. AAPL's Apple Music  reportedly  has half as many paid subscribers globally. 
Spotify  attributed the momentum to a promotion in the U.S. and Canada and continued strong growth in its family plan. ""We also saw strong growth from the expansion of our Google Home Mini promotion, as well as the price reduction to our Spotify Premium + Hulu offering in the U.S.,"" Spotify said.During the quarter, Spotify forayed into India, quickly ramping up to more than 2 million users in the country.Spotify now has a presence in 79 countries.Even as the service's user base expands, churn remained flat year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Forward ExpectationsSpotify said it expects second-quarter MAUs to grow 23-27 percent to 222-228 million and premium subscriber numbers to increase 29-34 percent to a range of 107 million to 110 million.The company guided revenue to 1.51 billion euros to 1.71 billion euros; gross margins to 23.5-25.5 percent; and its operating loss to 15 million to 95 million euros. For the full year, Spotify expects MAUs of 245 million to 265 million; a premium subscriber count of 117 million to 121 million; revenue of 6.35 billion euros to 6.8 billion euros; gross margins of 20-25 percent; and an operating loss of 180 million to 340 million euros. The company also said ARPUs are likely to decline by low single digits through the remainder of 2019, better than the 4.5-percent drop Buckingham's Harrigan is modeling.Harrigan said he expects the EU approval of the Article 17 on March 26 to have a favorable effect on Spotify and the music industry, as Alphabet Inc GOOGGOOGL-owned YouTube may now be forced to install filters for removing free user-generated shared content that infringes copyrights.Buckingham has a Buy rating on the shares of Spotify with a $165 price target.Spotify shares were down 0.67 percent at $137.32 at the time of publication Monday. Related Links:Spotify Closes In On 200M Monthly User Milestone, Despite Apple, Amazon Threats Analysts Positive On Spotify's Content Spending Despite Margin Impact ",2019-04-29

91,121,AAPL,"Red Apple: Earnings, Revenue Seen Pressured As iPhone Could Weigh",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13627169,"Apple Inc AAPL surprised many investors early this year by chopping its fiscal Q1 revenue guidance, a move CEO Tim Cook admitted was “disappointing.” That quarter’s results bore out Cook’s reduced expectations, with revenue falling 5% year-over-year as AAPL navigated a long list of challenges.Back then, AAPL’s once high-flying shares crumbled below $160 as investors wondered how the company would address slipping iPhone sales, a strong dollar, supply constraints, and economic weakness in China. Judging from how the stock has performed since early January, investors appear to think AAPL has pushed its way through at least some of these issues. Its fiscal Q2 earnings and conference call this afternoon might shed more light on exactly how much progress it’s made.AAPL shares recently traded at around $204, up 44% from the stock’s 52-week low posted in January. However, they’re still down more than 12% from their all-time high of approximately $233 reached last fall. There’s still worry about how a company that depended on the iPhone for its incredible run over the last decade can add to the growth story with iPhone sales heading the other way. Like its “FAANG” brethren, AAPL hasn’t been as much of a market leader so far in 2019 as in 2018, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing for the broader market. Last year, the FAANGs often seemed to determine overall direction on Wall Street. This year’s rally has been more broad-based and arguably healthier, while the FAANGs have yet to fully recover from their Q4 losses. That said, AAPL shares are outperforming the S&P 500 Index (SPX) year-to-date.Going into Tuesday’s fiscal Q2 earnings report, AAPL investors are likely to focus as always on iPhone sales, which fell 15% year-over year in the company’s Q1 while revenue from all other products rose 19%. Some analysts expect iPhone revenue growth to keep falling, at least until a 5G device is launched—possibly in 2020. Research firm CFRA predicts a 16% drop in iPhone sales in the company’s fiscal 2019.At Your ServicesAAPL’s other products include services, an area the company is more and more focused on as iPhone growth gets harder to boost. AAPL recently announced subscription services for video streaming (Apple TV+), news (Apple News+), and gaming (Apple Arcade), but, as Barron’s pointed out, didn’t share many relevant details. Tuesday’s earnings report and call might be a chance for investors to get more insight into those efforts, including possible pricing and launch date details. Still, there’s no way to be sure such logistical things will be discussed.Back in fiscal Q1, AAPL touted an installed base of 1.4 billion devices, which arguably gives it a very broad customer platform for its services business. Services revenue grew 19% to $10.9 billion in fiscal Q1, so we’ll find out Tuesday what the follow-up was to that strong performance. Services is a higher-margin business than hardware, which could potentially support AAPL from a profit standpoint as services becomes a bigger chunk of the company.AAPL has guided for fiscal Q2 revenue of between $55 billion and $59 billion, down from $61.1 billion in last year’s Q2. Looking OverseasInternational sales constituted 62% of the company’s revenue in Q1, so more than most companies, AAPL’s fortunes can be tugged back and forth by trade disputes like the ones between the U.S. and China and the U.S. and Europe. It also can get challenged by dollar strength, which tends to make U.S. products more expensive for overseas customers. In Q1 of 2019, the U.S. Dollar Index stayed mostly above 96, a relatively high level and well above approximately 90 a year earlier.It might be interesting to listen on Tuesday for any color Cook and other AAPL executives offer into the China situation, as that country’s economy seems to have improved a little thanks partly to recent fiscal stimulus from Beijing. Back in a January letter to investors, Cook mentioned “a climate of mounting uncertainty” regarding the Chinese economy and U.S./China trade negotiations. Nearly four months later, those negotiations continue.Investors might also want to consider listening for any more insight into AAPL’s legal settlement announced with supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) earlier this month. The two had been in a dispute over royalties and patents.Earlier this month, AAPL received an analyst downgrade and an upgrade from a different analyst in the same 24 hours. Some AAPL observers take a bullish point of view, noting that AAPL gained market share in China for three months in a row. The bearish school of thought argues that those market share gains might have come at a cost, with AAPL lowering prices and maybe suffering a margin squeeze. There’s potentially a compelling argument both ways. It’s definitely compelling to hear they’re picking up market share after all the China struggles they talked about back in early January.Figure 1: FALLING OFF PACE: Apple shares (candlestick) have outpaced the S&P 500 Index (purple line) year-to-date, but have lost a little ground over the last week as earnings approach.

That revenue would represent a 6.1% drop from a year ago.Options traders have priced in a 4% stock move in either direction around the upcoming earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim® platform.

92,127,AAPL,"Fed Day Underway, But Focus Might Be On Apple As Results Get Positive Read",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13639870,"The new month kicks off today with a Fed decision in the works. However, drama might hard to find because futures prices point to basically no chance of a rate move.With Fed Chair Jerome Powell and company in session today, things might be relatively quiet on Wall Street in the hours leading up to the 2 p.m. ET announcement. The tone did seem positive as things got underway following better-than-expected Apple Inc AAPL earnings and a sunny forecast from chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD. The other possible bullish factor at play this morning could be remarks from U.S. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who said he had “productive” meetings with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He in Beijing, Reuters reported. Tariff talks could remain front and center in coming weeks.Apple Takes Off As Earnings BeatThe after-hours highlight Tuesday was AAPL earnings, which were down from a year ago but above the Street’s expectations. The stock got an initial 5% lift in post-market trading, partly because revenue and earnings per share didn’t fall as much as third-party consensus estimates had predicted. It probably didn’t hurt, either, that the company announced more share repurchases and raised its quarterly dividend.Guidance for fiscal Q3 also was higher than Wall Street analysts had expected, and CEO Tim Cook told CNBC that the company’s China performance improved from the previous quarter and strengthened toward the end of the reporting period. While some of that might have reflected price cuts, it could possibly come as a bit of a relief to people wondering how China’s slowing economy affected business for a company where international sales make up 61% of revenue. That said, iPhone revenue continued its downward drift in AAPL’s fiscal Q2, falling 17% year-over-year. It was the second quarter in a row of declining growth for a product that makes up more than half of the company’s revenue. Services revenue did rise 16% from a year ago, and AAPL has been touting its services business in recent quarters as a growth element. In its call, AAPL talked about strong results for the App Store, Apple Pay, and Apple Music.One interesting note is that this is the second-straight quarter when AAPL reported a drop in revenue only to see its stock jump after earnings. If it seems like investors have lowered their expectations a little, that’s probably not off base. There’s just not a lot of excitement around the iPhone now, and some analysts say there won’t be until a 5G device is launched—possibly in 2020.Another thing AAPL talked about on its call is the headwind from a strong dollar, something that’s likely getting harder to ignore for many U.S. companies. The Dollar Index finished Tuesday at about 97.5, a little below last week’s multi-month highs. However, it’s stayed mostly above 96 this year, up from around 90 early last year, and that’s been a drag on results for some multinational firms. At this point, it would probably take more signs of overseas economic strength to put pressure on the greenback, and while some data out of Europe early this week did look promising (see more below), that’s not necessarily a trend.The other tech news late Tuesday came from Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, which surpassed third-party consensus with its results and gave a forecast for possible market share gains. Shares rose 4% in pre-market hours, and that seemed to lend some support to a few other chip firms as well.More strong earnings news in the mix this morning include results from CVS Health Corp CVS, Humana Inc HUM, and Yum! Brands, Inc. YUM. Same-store sales at YUM rose much more than analysts had expected, a good sign from the consumer demand side. Basically, we’ve seen mainly positive results from a wide group of industries since yesterday’s closing bell, and that might give the market an additional tailwind.Fed Day Lacking in DramaTrading might be a little slow this morning ahead of the Fed’s decision, but there’s not really much drama associated with the gathering today.Going into the meeting’s conclusion, expectations for any sort of rate move by the Fed remain near zero, according to CME futures. Odds are 98% of the Fed standing pat, with 2% chances of a 25-basis point rate cut. Looking ahead to June, chances of a rate cut rise to around 21%, with chances for lower rates rising to more than 65% by the end of the year. The Fed hasn’t cut rates since the 2008-09 recession.As we often see when the meeting holds little sense of urgency, attention might turn more to what Powell says in his press conference afterward. The recent higher-than-expected Q1 gross domestic product (GDP) could be one thing he gets asked about, as the Fed has been forecasting slower growth. Does Powell consider the Q1 number an outlier, with possible slowness potentially pushed into later this year? Or could the Q1 data mean the Fed might have been too pessimistic? We’ll have to wait and see if he addresses this.Inflation also remains below the Fed’s target, and even the word “deflation” has started being mentioned by some pundits. Powell could conceivably get asked what the Fed might consider doing to get inflation up to its targeted 2% level, along with what factors he thinks are keeping inflation so low despite a faster-growing economy.Also, there’s been a lot of scuttlebutt lately about chances of the Fed lowering rates. The latest came Tuesday when President Trump urged rate cuts. Don’t be too surprised if someone at the press conference directly asks Powell if he and the Fed plan to cut rates and when, but also don’t be surprised if Powell doesn’t offer a direct answer. The Fed has been sticking to its guns for a while now saying it will focus on data, and it seems unlikely that’s going to change anytime soon. We’ll be back after the Fed decision with an update on the Fed’s statement and Powell’s press conference.High AchieversAfter posting new all-time intraday highs on Monday, stocks had themselves a dull Tuesday as many investors seemed to take a cautious stance ahead of the Fed meeting. The S&P 500 Index (SPX) did post a new record close, but didn’t take out Monday’s intraday high. Nasdaq (COMP) came under pressure after achieving record highs of its own earlier in the week, hurt by earnings news (see more below).Stock sectors traditionally seen as defensive, including Utilities, Staples, and Real Estate, were among the leaders Tuesday. Those sectors also tend to offer relatively high dividends, arguably making them a bit more attractive at times like this when the bond market keeps rallying and rates are under pressure.That was the case again Tuesday as 10-year yields fell back toward 2.5%. They didn’t seem to get much help from last week’s strong Q1 GDP data, and might have seen weakness Tuesday in part due to a batch of weak data from China. The softness in China got countered somewhat from a surprisingly strong European growth number. The 19 eurozone countries grew 0.4% in Q1 compared with Q4, the European Union statistics agency estimated. That was the best growth since Q2 last year, and might be a reasons to argue against some suggestions that Europe could slip into recession.The Communication Services sector got hammered Tuesday, mainly in the wake of disappointing earnings from Alphabet Inc GOOG. It’s unclear, analysts said, exactly what led to the company’s slowing advertising growth in Q1, but it might simply be a matter of more competition. Some analysts also worry about the company’s spending trends. Whatever the case, GOOG had its worst trading day in six years.Figure 1: AAPL JOLT: Shares of Apple got a big lift right after the close when the company reported earnings late Tuesday, as this one-day chart demonstrates. At its highs in post-market trading, the stock reached levels not seen since early November. Data Source: Nasdaq. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  Four in a Row: April marked the fourth-consecutive month of gains for the S&P 500 Index (SPX) following December’s 9% decline. In fact, only two of the last 12 months (October and December) actually saw losses in the SPX, despite that nagging feeling you might have that the entire Q4 was a disaster. Stocks actually rose slightly in November between their October and December collapses. Now the market is roughly back to where it was at the end of last September, so those Q4 losses might feel long ago. People tend to emphasize the strong performance of cyclical stocks since the start of 2019, but looking back to the end of last summer’s rally, Utilities has actually been the top-performing sector, adding on 9% to the level it was at in late September when the SPX last reached these highs. The two follow-up sectors since then are Communication Services and Real Estate.What Inversion?: Speaking of long ago, it seems like a lot of time has passed since late March, when many analysts were warning about how the Treasury yield inversion might point toward economic weakness ahead. Since then, longer-term yields have gained some traction vs. short-term ones, often a sign of economic growth. Early this week, 10-year yields widened their lead over two-year yields to more than 20 basis points. That’s relatively low historically, but compared to a single-digit gap earlier this year, it seems like a lot.The three-month yield, which had run up a slight lead over the 10-year at one point, now trails the 10-year by 7 basis points. That said, 10-year yields remain historically low at 2.5%, which is kind of a dichotomy when you consider that stocks are at all-time highs. High stock prices can often be accompanied by losses in the bond market, sending yields higher. This time around, the Fed’s dovish stance might be holding yields back, helped in part by weak economic growth overseas. The latest inflation data didn’t appear to give any new ammunition to anyone looking for a pullback in bonds, and might also look supportive for dividend-paying sectors that often compete with the bond market to draw in yield-seeking investors.Foreign Affairs: We haven’t seen a lot of evidence of global growth concerns crop up in corporate earnings, and CEOs have set a positive overall tone about the global economy. In some cases, their international businesses seem to be thriving despite recent slower growth in Europe and China, These firms include Starbucks Corporation SBUX, United Technologies Corporation UTX, and United Parcel Services, Inc. UPS. Some other companies with major foreign footprints, including Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Facebook Inc FB, showed no signs of foreign weakness hurting their growth, MarketWatch noted. That said a couple of major U.S. firms, namely Caterpillar Inc CAT and 3M Co MMM, have reported softness in their international results this earnings season. Both of those companies cited weakness in Asia-Pacific, with MMM specifically mentioning China. Also, AAPL talked about strong dollar headwinds, as mentioned above.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

93,130,AAPL,"Good, Not Great: Analysts Break Down Apple's Quarter",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13640101,"Apple, Inc. AAPL stock jumped more than 6.5 percent Wednesday after the company reported a big March quarter earnings beat and issued better-than-expected guidance.For the fiscal second quarter, Apple reported $2.46 in EPS on revenue of $58 billion. Both numbers topped consensus analyst expectations of $2.36 and $57.3 billion, respectively. Apple also guided for third-quarter revenue of between $52.5 billion and $54.5 billion, ahead of analyst estimates of $51.9 billion.Several analysts have weighed in on Apple stock following the big earnings beat. Here’s a sampling of what they’ve had to say.iPhone Business StabilizingBank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said Apple’s trade-in initiatives seem to be resonating with iPhone users.“We believe consumers are not realizing the residual value of their iPhones, and the trade-in program acts as a replacement to carrier subsidies following the introduction of higher priced iPhones,” Mohan wrote in a note.UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said Apple’s quarter was solid, but there was no new information to change the long-term outlook for the company.“The worst is behind us in iPhone (mgmt was clear that March was a much better month and our data already shows AAPL is essentially at replacement) and non-iPhone hardware categories are showing some strength (though clearly nowhere near as important as iPhone) ahead of easing FX headwinds,” Arcuri wrote.KeyBanc analyst Andy Hargreaves said bulls should feel good about Apple‘s quarter, but the stock is fully valued at its current level.“We believe Apple's overall growth rate remains constrained by a saturated high-end smartphone market and decelerating Services tied to iPhone,” Hargreaves wrote.Looking to gain an edge in your trading and investing? Look no further than the Benzinga Trading & Investing Summit this June 20 in NYC!China Concerns LingerGreater China revenue was down 21.5 percent in the second quarter, but Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers said investors shouldn’t sweat China too much.“Shares of Apple traded higher post-close as we think the company’s June quarter guide + commentary support the view that we are now seeing indications stabilizing/bottoming iPhone demand (particularly in China), coupled with continued solid double-digit growth in Apple’s services business (+16% y/y),” Rakers wrote.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said strong June quarter guidance highlights just how far Apple has rebounded since it started 2019 with a guidance cut.“With Cook and Cupertino facing hurricane-like headwinds in China, iPhone demand appears to have weathered the storm and is starting to ‘rise from the ashes’ of the December debacle with a stronger growth trajectory now forecasted for the coming quarters and a healthy product cycle around the corner slated for September,” Ives wrote.Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang said that, while guidance was better than expected, there are lingering concerns about Apple’s 2019 product cycle in China.“We remain the most concerned about Apple’s new product cycle, set to launch in the 2nd half of this year, as we believe demand in China will still be challenging,” Zhang wrote.Catalysts AheadMorgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said Apple has now cleared the path for bullish catalysts in its Services segment and the 5G upgrade cycle.“Better than expected June Q guide and more bullish iPhone commentary were positive surprises against cautious investor positioning,” Huberty wrote.Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth said Apple’s expanding Services platform, including gaming, news and TV offerings, will help drive long-term earnings and revenue growth.“I believe upside to the $220 to $240 range exists over the next 12 months and continue to recommend purchase,” Feinseth wrote.Gene Munster said the most important part of the March quarter for investors is that there weren’t any negative surprises.“Growth in non-iPhone revenue is evidence of strength in the Apple ecosystem and should slowly help investors get comfortable moving beyond the iPhone cycle story in the coming quarters,” Munster wrote.Ratings And Price Targets

98,137,AAPL,"After Sliding On Powell's Words, Stocks Look Flat As Under Armour, Qualcomm Report",https://www.benzinga.com/node/13652243,"The Fed threw one right down the middle late Wednesday, declining to hike or cut interest rates and hinting that it might not make any additional rate moves for a while.Stocks responded like a child who just had the cookie jar taken away. The jar in this case appeared to be hopes that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell would dangle the chance of a near-term interest rate cut. However, like a strict parent denying that cookie, Powell stuck to his guns. The S&P 500 Index (SPX), which had been up about 0.2% right after the Fed decision, slid 0.75% by the end of the session.Stocks took on a more neutral tone in pre-market trading early Thursday as investors geared up for Friday’s payrolls report. Earnings continue to roll in and might take focus off the Fed, but it’s possible that Powell’s words yesterday could continue to reverberate for a while.Powell Dashes Rate Cut HopesAsked point-blank at his press conference Wednesday if the Fed was considering a rate cut, Powell replied, “We don’t see a strong case for moving in either direction,” adding that the Fed is comfortable with its current target range of between 2.25% and 2.5%. The Fed said in its statement that it plans to be “patient” about future moves.Stocks had rallied to record highs late last month, but it’s unclear how much of that was based on rate easing hopes. Better-than-expected earnings and optimism for a deal with China also probably played a big role. Few investors actually seemed to expect a cut at Wednesday’s meeting, judging from Fed futures, but the CME FedWatch tool had predicted about a 20% chance of a cut in June. That sank to about 7% by late Wednesday after Powell’s words. Stocks sank along with bullish hopes for more Fed stimulus.Chances are still around 50% for a cut by the end of the year, however, and the futures market doesn’t see any chance of rates going up in 2019. However, the 50% odds of a 2019 rate cut are way down from around 75% earlier this week.In a sense, the Fed’s reluctance to ease borrowing costs could be viewed as bullish, even though that wasn’t how the market saw it on Wednesday. If the Fed feels rates can stay at current levels, it likely signals that the central bank believes the economy can continue growing without more stimulus. It’s hard to see that as a negative if you’re looking for signs of U.S. economic strength.  Also, for those who might be worried about current “high” rates potentially clipping growth, remember, the target range remains low on a historic basis.The other thing that might have bothered some investors was Powell’s description of current low inflation as “transitory,” and his belief that it will eventually rebound toward the Fed’s targeted 2%. If that’s how the Fed sees things, it arguably makes a rate cut even less likely anytime soon. After all, lower rates have a tendency at times to generate rising prices. With that in mind, the Fed might be hesitant to ease policy. The argument could be made though, that one way to get inflation back to the Fed’s target would be to drop rates. We’ll have to wait and see where the Fed eventually lands.As Powell said, inflation can rise and fall over the course of a given year, and it’s probably best to take a long-term view. At a core rate of 1.6% now, inflation might be getting beaten down by weak demand overseas and by slower business investment here at home. Those are two trends to consider watching as investors try to figure out what the Fed might do next.Data DisappointAnother thing to consider keeping an eye on is data over the next week or two, including Friday’s April payrolls report (see more below). The latest data this week seemed a little listless compared with last Friday’s surprisingly strong 3.2% gross domestic product (GDP) growth for Q1. Both March construction spending and the April ISM Manufacturing numbers came in below analysts’ expectations. Mortgage applications fell pretty sharply last week, and the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index for March also failed to shine. Chicago PMI for April looked particularly flat at 52.6, the lowest level since January 2017.Before Powell splashed a little cold water on the parade, stocks had been flat to higher Wednesday. A report right around the time the Fed meeting ended that the U.S. and China may have a trade deal to announce as soon as next Friday helped give the market a lift. Also, Apple Inc AAPL shares rose almost 5% on better-than-expected earnings and guidance after reporting late Tuesday.Thursday brought another slew of earnings data. Qualcomm, Inc. QCOM, Dow Dupont Inc DWDP, Yeti Holdings Inc YETI, and Under Armour Inc UAA are among companies in the spotlight. News looked good from UAA, while QCOM beat third-party consensus views on earnings and revenue but gave guidance that came in under the Street’s expectations.The data calendar later today includes March factory orders, but it’s likely most people will be focused on tomorrow’s payrolls report (see more below). There’s been a little uptick in volatility the last couple days as the market faced earnings from Apple, the Fed meeting, and jobs data. The VIX—sometimes thought of as the market’s “fear indicator”—rose above 14 early Thursday, up from below 13 earlier this week. That could signal a bit more choppiness ahead.For the S&P 500 Index (SPX), Wednesday’s showing was its worst for any day since March 22, but it did remain well above 2900 and not far off of recent all-time highs. From the 30,000-foot view, a day like Wednesday’s might feel unpleasant, but can sometimes be healthy for a market that’s been flying so high for so long. Nearly every sector finished lower, with Energy really taking it on the chin thanks in part to rising U.S. crude stockpiles (see below). Figure 1: Big Reversal: This 9-month chart, going back to early August, shows how 10-year yields (candlestick) have reversed their upward path even as the S&P 500 Index (purple line) bottomed out in December and rose sharply as the Fed stepped back from rate hikes. Data Sources: Cboe, S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Payrolls Up Next: April payrolls loom Friday morning, the next highlight in a week that’s been full of them. Job growth is expected to be around 200,000, according to a Briefing.com consensus, with unemployment holding steady at 3.8% and hourly pay up 0.3% from the month before. That would be a bigger rise in wages than the 0.1% monthly increase seen in March. Investors might want to keep a close eye on construction and manufacturing jobs to see if they popped back in April after some weak months.It might also be interesting to see if the government makes any revisions to the February and March data Friday. In March, 196,000 jobs were created, about 20,000 above expectations, and way above the growth of 33,000 in February. It’s still possible that the dichotomy between those two months might have something to do with the government shutdown in January, so we’ll see.Test Flight: How can a company help address customer fears after its product is involved in two fatal accidents? Boeing Co BA faces that question as it works to get its 737 MAX planes back into service. One idea the company appears to be thinking about is a confidence-building strategy it used a few years ago after its 787 airliner was grounded due to battery problems. That is, having its own executives take some of the first flights. In 2013, then-Boeing CEO Jim McNerney was one of 219 passengers on United Airlines UAL Flight 1 of the 787 from Houston to Chicago, CNN reported at the time. He was joined by executives from the airline.At the recent BA investor meeting, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said he’s already ridden on two 737 MAX test flights equipped with updated software, CNN reported. He also said he and other BA executives will be on some of the first flights once the plane is back in commercial service. “It will include me and many others,” he said. “This is a really important part in showing our confidence in our product.”Crude Calculations: Either U.S. crude producers are working overtime the last couple of weeks, or motorists are reacting to high gas prices by driving less. There may be other explanations, too, but whatever the case, crude stockpiles are up pretty dramatically since mid-April. They rose nearly 10 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported Wednesday, following a 5.5-million-barrel build the week before. One possibility is that producers might building up supplies ahead of the summer “driving season,” which traditionally starts around Memorial Day. Total crude inventories are at 470 million barrels, about in line with the five-year average. If crude supplies do keep building into summer, that might be a sign of demand issues, which can be a sign of economic softness. So it might be worth keeping an eye on these weekly reports.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

99,139,AAPL,Learn About The Everything Store To The Everything Company: The Amazon Story According To Brad Stone – At Transparency19,https://www.benzinga.com/node/13656252," In 2013, when Brad Stone set out to write about the history of Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, it was hardly the company we know (and rely on) today. A December 2013 60 Minutes interview revealed that Amazon had 225 million customers worldwide. Just five years later, in December 2018, Amazon reported that Amazon Prime alone boasted an astounding 101+ million customers solely in the United States.The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon tracks Amazon's incredible growth throughout the years, from ""fledgling startup to one of the most successful retailers of all time"" (Simon & Schuster).Stone will join us on stage at Transparency19 in Atlanta, Georgia next week as one of our dynamic day two keynote speakers. He spoke with FreightWaves about the retail giant – the organization that ""appeared to be a boring tech company to any given outsider, but was actually much more interesting,"" Stone stated.""By 2013, Amazon had gotten into enterprise computing, ebooks and much more,"" Stone explained. And according to Stone, it became clear that Amazon was capable of much more than just selling things online.""I started the book a year before 2013. I'd covered Amazon for The New York Times and Bloomberg, and it occurred to me that people had written books about Apple Inc AAPL, Facebook, Inc. FB, Google GOOG and Yahoo, but no one had written the Amazon story,"" Stone noted.While writing The Everything Store, it was important for Stone to talk to as many people affiliated with Amazon as he possibly could. ""I found myself talking to people who'd spent time with Jeff Bezos as a kid, people who had been at the company since the early years...anyone who could give me some insight. I was fortunate that I had almost 20 years of company history to work with at that point.""  ""I think we take the Amazon we know today for granted. I'm looking forward to telling the Amazon story, introducing Transparency19 attendees to the absolute juggernaut it is today. What seemed like the most boring idea has grown into more than we ever thought possible,"" said Stone.""That company, since the book came out, has grown immensely. It's invented Alexa, and it's become a sort of Hollywood business. There's a lot that's not in the 2013 book, and that's why I'm working on the sequel now,"" he announced.Stone told FreightWaves that he anticipates a 2021 release for his sequel. ""The rise of Amazon and of its inventive founder, Jeff Bezos, is hands-down the most compelling business story of our time,"" said Stone in a press release from Simon & Schuster, which will publish the sequel, Amazon Unbound.""Over the last few years, I've come to realize that my first book explored only the first few chapters of this historic story. Now I want to chronicle how the ‘everything store' became the ‘everything company,'"" Stone concluded.Stone intends to capture the story of a company that has defied everyone's expectations, defined the market, and is scaring its competitors, causing regulators to think about the extent to which tech companies are shaping the economy.For the full Transparency19 lineup, click here. There's still time to register for the hottest tech event in the industry. We hope to see you May 6-8 in Atlanta!Brad Stone is a senior writer for Bloomberg Businessweek and the author of The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon, which provides a definitive account of the e-commerce giant and offers keen insights into the history and remarkable growth of a company widely regarded as uniquely innovative, disruptive and often polarizing. Since joining Bloomberg from The New York Times in the fall of 2010, Stone has written more than a dozen cover stories on companies such as Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Chinese search firm Baidu.
