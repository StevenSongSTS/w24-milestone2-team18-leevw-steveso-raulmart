      "Most positive: Few investors would argue 2018 was a good year for their portfolios. No one would argue that it was better than 2017. A historical look at TD Ameritrade’s Investor Movement Index (IMX) paints a fairly stark portrait of just how much worse last year was than its predecessor.Turns out, that gut check is more true than many might realize. The December 2018 release of the IMX, which tracks buying and selling behavior among the broker’s 11 million retail clients, posted its lowest score in more than two years at 4.41. That score is also within a tenth of its all-time low of 4.33, which it hit in March 2016.Compare that to the December 2017’s IMX report, which marked the index’s all-time high of 8.59.While there’s plenty of reasons underlying the difference in performance between the two years, the sheer rate of the drop each December bookends is worth closer scrutiny.First, A RecapEven a cursory glance at the historical IMX chart reveals the tide shifted quickly entering the new year. Following the December 2017 peak, there was a massive drawdown of nearly 10 percent in January as market leaders like Apple Inc. AAPL and Facebook, Inc. FB started to flounder, both ending the month in the red.Then the February correction hit, which drove both the broad market down 10.2 percent and sent the IMX down more than 23.5 percent.As volatility lingered, so did the investor pessimism. The IMX gradually shaved off points in both March and April, hitting a low of 4.79. April’s low reading was the first time the index had fallen below 5 since 2016.Then, like the market, the IMX spent the summer steadily building back the gains it had lost in Q1. By late August, the S&P 500 managed to retake new highs while, in September, the IMX managed to top its February level.Which brings the story to Q4 2018.Driven by a conglomeration of interest rate fears, anxiety over trade and evidence of slowing long-term growth from Nasdaq tech leaders like Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and the aforementioned Apple, the market’s volatile October, November and December ended up wiping out the entire year’s gains. The fallout didn’t manifest on the survey until November and December, which saw two consecutive 0.8 point drops, something that seemed rare back when it happened in January.2018 Post-MortemOne of the most telling aspects when comparing 2018’s investor activity to that of 2017 is the number of dramatic rises and falls between IMX data points. While 2017 only saw one 10-percent jump between October and November, the 2018 IMX fell by at least 10 percent four times, in February and March and again in November and December.These movements generally align, and even occasionally preceded, sympathetic trends in the broad market, with late 2017’s 15 percent IMX spike seemingly anticipating the December/January market rally.However, a more compelling correlation appears when Comparing the IMX to CBOE’s Volatility index (VIX). Taken this way, the 15-percent gain the index saw in late 2017 and subsequent +10 percent movements in the index anticipated the drastic swings in the market in the following weeks and months.While the investor optimism that manifested as a 15-percent spike in the IMX’s reading could be seen as a indicator of the market’s subsequent rally in December and January, it may be more accurately seen as forecasting the return of volatility as 2018 rolled on.What It Means For 2019The increased frequency of 10-percent shifts in a sentiment indicator like the IMX might be the most valuable piece of information investors look at when considering what the months ahead hold.The sharply negative November and December 2018 IMX readings might reveal a period of good equity performance, something already starting to manifest in the heart of January.The continued shifts in investor sentiment, however, might more accurately forecast continued volatility into the near future. Given the dramatic gaps between the months, there’s still a good chance volatility might creep back in again until investor activity becomes more stable month-to-month.Interpreting the signals in the IMX is up to each investor, but the whims of the market will have the ultimate say.\n",
      "Most negative: A stronger-than-expected government report on the nation’s employment situation provided investors with some good news to cap a dismal week that saw worries about global economic growth ratchet up.Total nonfarm payrolls in December surged 312,000, well above the 180,000 jobs economists in a Briefing.com consensus had been expecting. November’s number was revised upward from 155,000 to 176,000. The report showed that average hourly earnings on a monthly basis rose more than expected. That figure came in at 0.4% instead of the 0.3% gain that had been expected. Over the past year, average hourly earnings are up 3.2%. Treasury rates rose after the announcement, reversing much of yesterday’s fall in yields. Also significant is an uptick in the labor participation rate, to 63.1, up from 62.9, perhaps indicating a rise in employment opportunities for previously “discouraged” workers.  Jobs Report Comes On Top Of Positive SentimentBut overall, the stock market maintained most of its gains immediately following the report. Trading before the jobs number saw equity index futures on the rebound after stocks tanked the day before.Apple Inc. AAPL shares, which had helped drag down the market yesterday, were bouncing along with other tech stocks. Shares of Netflix, Inc. NFLX and Intel Corporation INTC were helping with the positive momentum as they rose following bullish analyst notes.Even yesterday’s beaten-down airline stocks seemed ready to rally. Delta Airlines DAL shares fell nearly 9% yesterday after reporting lower-than-expected revenue growth during the holiday season. In response, United Continental UAL and American Airlines Group AAL slid 5% and 7.5%, respectively. All three airlines were up about 1% in premarket trade today. Still, based on DAL’s results, consider watching whether airline stocks will hit more turbulence as lower fuel prices could create expectations for cheaper flights, which could pressure profits.On the trade front, news that China and the United States have scheduled trade talks in Beijing for Jan. 7-8 was arguably also a positive for stocks. With Apple blaming deteriorating conditions in China for its surprise downward revenue revision, and a top Trump economic adviser telling CNN that other U.S. companies could take a hit until a deal is struck with China, investors may be thinking that pressure is ratcheting up on leaders to resolve their trade differences. Worries over China’s economy have helped drive stock market volatility of late as the trade war between the world’s two largest economies drags on. This week, investors have seen solid evidence of problems in the Chinese economy, with disappointing manufacturing data and Apple’s lower guidance. As Goes Apple …Everything that has mass in the universe has a gravitational pull; the bigger the object, the bigger the pull. That’s why Newton’s apple fell toward the earth.While it wasn’t gravity that pulled Apple down on Thursday, its fall was still precipitous. The iPhone maker’s shares dropped nearly 10% and helped pull down other companies in its orbit. Tech companies were the hardest hit, with that sector the biggest loser in the S&P 500 (SPX).The declines came after AAPL said its revenue for the holiday quarter ended Dec. 29 would be significantly lower than expected amid lower iPhone sales in China as the trade war continues. AAPL and other tech companies are heavily tied to the world’s second largest economy, both for sales of their end-products and for the supply chains that help make those products. AAPL specifically cited the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China, which have dogged Wall Street for months and contributed to the worst year for stocks in a decade in 2018. Disappointing Manufacturing DataBut a declining business climate in China, the world’s second largest economy, isn’t just a drag on tech companies. AAPL’s announcement underscores an increasing worry among investors that global economic growth could be in for a slowdown.The disclosure from AAPL came on the heels of disappointing manufacturing data from China and Europe. A recent index onChina’s manufacturing sector showed contraction for the first time in 19 months. And recent manufacturing data across the eurozone indicated a broad-based slowdown in the region.If that weren’t enough to spook investors about the global economy, a reading on U.S. manufacturing came in weaker than expected on Thursday, also helping to push stocks lower. The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index fell from 59.3 to 54.1 in December. While that still showed expansion, it was a bigger drop than a Briefing.com consensus had expected. Economists there were forecasting the reading to come in at 57.8.That left investors to digest disappointing manufacturing data from three of the world’s key economies even as they were handed a big piece of anecdotal evidence of a potential economic slowing in the form of Apple’s lowered guidance. Risk Appetite Muted on ThursdayMeanwhile, the U.S. budget impasse and partial government shutdown continued, keeping about 800,000 federal workers away from their jobs. It seems likely that the longer those workers remain out of their jobs, the less they will spend and the more pessimistic on the economy they will become. That’s not good news considering recent consumer confidence numbers, which fell more than expected.With all the unease swirling about, investors retreated from stocks and into perceived safe havens. Both gold and the yen climbed, and U.S. government debt yields fell. The 10-year Treasury yield dropped farther away from the psychologically important 3% mark. One thing to consider watching as trading unfolds today: If investors and traders feel confident enough to hold onto riskier positions heading into the weekend, that could bode well for bulls on Monday, but if not then we could see the market give back some of this morning’s gains.Figure 1: Apple and the Market: While correlation doesn’t always mean causation, Apple has often been a market leader, both on the upside and on the downside. Last year, a peak for the stock (purple line) came at roughly the same time as a peak for the S&P 500 (candlestick chart). Recently, both have been falling sharply.

Past performance does not guarantee future results.Investors Increasingly Believe in Dovish Fed: As government debt yields slumped amid safe-haven bond buying on Thursday, the 2-year Treasury yield briefly fell below the effective fed funds rate of 2.4% (recall that the Fed has set its target Fed funds rate in a range between 2.25% and 2.5%). That may mean that investors don’t think the central bank will be able to raise rates as much as it has previously telegraphed. The latest from the Fed suggests that policy makers have been considering two interest rates hikes this year. But based on futures activity, the market has its own ideas. Futures are showing about a 6% chance of a cut in the fed funds rate by the March meeting and a greater likelihood of two cuts between now and December than even one hike, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool. It may be worth being cautious with these predictions, however, as they could be setting up the market for disappointment. After all, the U.S. economy is still expanding, and the Fed might end up being more hawkish than the market wants.Earnings Season Coming Up: With all the doom and gloom swirling about the market, it may be easy to forget that 2018 saw some bumper corporate earnings and this upcoming earnings season is expected to also show earnings growth. According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, Q4 2018 earnings per share (EPS) growth is expected to come in at 13.7% while full year 2018 EPS growth is pegged at 22.5%. But as investment research firm CFRA reminds us, S&P 500 companies through Q3 2018 had recorded 27 back-to-back quarters where actual results exceeded end-of quarter estimates. If that happens this upcoming earnings season, investors might have something to cheer about. Happy Job Hunting?: There’s another labor-related economic report on the horizon in the form of the monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report. The labor turnover report focuses on job availability, along with hiring and separation trends such as retirement. What might matter most for this report is “voluntary quits,” meaning workers who have the confidence to leave a job for what they believe will be a better one. Keep in mind that the upcoming report is for November, so even if people were confident enough to leave their jobs then – perhaps in hopes of making more money at a new job as the new year approached – that might be reflective of stronger sentiment than what we have now. Still, it could be interesting to see how confident people were in finding a new job even with the tight labor market, especially in light of today’s monster jobs report.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

      "Most neutral: (Monday Market Open) Investors appear optimistic to start the new week as equity index futures headed higher ahead of the opening bell. However, there’s a full economic calendar this week including the Federal Open Market Committee’s interest rate decision on Wednesday.Potential Market MoversThis morning, the CME FedWatch Tool was calculating a 77.5% probability that the Fed would raise the overnight rate 75 basis points on Wednesday. The probabilities are likely to rise the closer we get to the announcement, so it will likely fall to the accompanying statement and press conference with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that to move the market on the rate picture.Thursday’s gross domestic product (GDP) has the potential to be controversial as well because of the ongoing debate over what constitutes a recession. Historically, two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth have defined a recession, but some, including the White House, are arguing this time it’s different because of the strength of the U.S. jobs market.In the first quarter, GDP was -1.3%. Currently, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow tool is projecting -1.6% growth the second quarter. However, the unemployment rate is just 3.6%. Therefore, all eyes will be on the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) because they get the privilege of determining whether or not a recession is “official.”Whatever happens with the labeling, the GDP report should help analysts and investors see where the weaknesses are in the economy.However, recession fears aren’t limited to the U.S. The July German Business Climate Index, which measures economic expectations for the next six months, came in lower than expected and much lower than the previous month. The survey of German manufacturers, builders, wholesalers, and retailers revealed that many of them are expecting a recession in Germany. The German DAX was trading 0.3% higher overnight despite the news.Today’s a packed earnings calendar with releases from NXP Semiconductors NXPI, Whirlpool WHR, and F5 Networks FFIV. But there are big tech hitters reporting throughout the week including Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta META, Apple AAPL, and Amazon AMZN. Energy giants Exxon Mobil XOM and Chevron CVX will also report this week.Reviewing the Market MinutesThe stock market ended a positive week on a sour note when the S&P 500® index (SPX), Nasdaq ($COMP), and Dow Jones Industrials ($DJI) respectively fell 0.93%, 1.87%, and 0.43% on Friday. However, the indexes did end the week with gains of 2.6%, 2.0%, and 3.3% respectively.Stocks appeared to be dragged down by negative manufacturing news from Australia, France, Germany, and Japan. Each reported preliminary manufacturing numbers that suggested manufacturing in each country was contracting. The news fed the global economic slowdown narrative that has been haunting stocks.  Internet stocks took an additional hit as Snap SNAP and Twitter TWTR reported earnings misses. SNAP had the biggest miss by far, causing it to plunge 39.08% on the day. However, Twitter was able to eke out a 0.81% gain. Despite the split reactions to the misses, other internet stocks fell. Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Pinterest (PINS) tumbled 5.63%, 7.59%, and 13.51% respectively.The consumer discretionary sector was the week’s top performer for the week as the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector Index rose about 5% from Monday’s opening price. The Industrials Select Sector Index climbed just shy of 3.5%. The Materials Select Sector Index and the Real Estate Select Sector Index both rallied 2.8% to round out the top three sectors.Investors appeared to ignore stocks in the defensive sectors as health care, utilities, and consumer staples ended the week near even.Not only was the consumer discretionary sector the best sector last week, it’s on track to be the best for the month. The consumer discretionary index was up 12.25% from the first of July to last Friday’s close. The Technology Select Sector Index is in second place at 9.14%. These two indexes represented the only sectors to outpace the S&P 500 over that time frame. The Utilities Select Sector Index was the only sector index to be in the red so far this month, down -1.84%.\n",
      "\n",
      "CHART OF THE DAY: CONSUMER STRENGTH: The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector Index ($IXY—candlesticks) has underperformed the S&P 500 (SPX—pink) over the last 12 months. However, the consumer discretionary index is gaining in relative strength (green) against the S&P 500, which could be a bullish sign for the sector. Data Sources: ICE, S&P Dow Jones Indices.

      "\n",
      "Three Things to WatchSKEWED UP: The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector Index closed near its June high last week as investors found a taste for growth stocks. Amazon AMZN and Tesla TSLA are the two largest companies in the capitalization-weighted index and account for approximately 42% of its performance. With AMZN and TSLA skewing the returns of the index, it’s difficult to say if investors are bullish on consumer discretionary stocks in total or just Amazon and Tesla. An investor would need to break down the industry groups within the sector to better determine the demand.EARNINGS UPDATE: According to Refinitiv, S&P 500 companies for the Q2 2022 earnings season are on track for 6.2% earnings growth year over year. However, when excluding energy, growth falls to -3.2%. So far, 106 of the S&P 500’s companies have reported earnings with 75.5% beating analysts’ estimates, which is above the long-term average of 66.1% but lower than the previous four-quarter average of 80.6%.The energy sector has the highest earnings growth rate at a whopping 259.6% year over year. Industrials are second at 26%, and financials are the worst at -22.1%.GETTING BEAT: S&P 500 companies are still reporting fewer and smaller earnings surprises than the last five-year average, according to FactSet. The financials and communications sectors have had the greatest number of earnings misses. Utilities and health care have reported the highest number of earnings beats, while energy and industrials have reported the fewest. However, energy and industrials are also reporting a high number of earnings in-line with analyst estimates.Notable Calendar ItemsJuly 26: New home sales and earnings from Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Visa V, Coca-Cola KO, McDonald’s MCD, United Parcel Services UPS, and 3M MMMJuly 27: Durable goods orders, Pending home sales, FOMC interest rate decision and earnings from Meta META, Qualcomm QCOM, Rio Tinto RIO, Boeing BA, and Automatic Data Processing ADPJuly 28: Gross domestic product (GDP) and earnings from Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Mastercard MA, Intel INTC, and Caterpillar CATJuly 29: PCE Price Index and earnings from Exxon Mobil XOM, Procter & Gamble PG, and Chevron CVXAug 1: ISM Manufacturing PMI and earnings from Activision Blizzard ATVI, Simon Property SPG, Devon Energy DVN, and Aflac AFLTD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.
